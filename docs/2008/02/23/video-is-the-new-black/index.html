<div class="content">
  <p>Kudos to Linda McCutcheon: <span class="caps">SVP </span>of New Media at <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nielsenbusinessmedia.com/index.html">Nielsen Media</a> for the line. Linda was a panelist for two of our sessions at the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliosummit.com/program/wg_ex.htm">Executive Management</a> work sessions at the Folio Summit last week, where online video was a very hot topic.</p>
<p>Video is indeed one of the hottest topics amongst online media companies today. Should you be investing? Experimenting? What&#39;s the right formula, short clips, long form, user driven, original programming? What&#39;s the right business model? What are the implications for content teams? Should you just give cameras to editors? What&#39;s the right advertising model? What&#39;s the right sales model?</p>
<p>When in doubt, always follow the audience. Research firm <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a> projects that by 2011 more than 85% of the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Internet population will consume Internet video, up from roughly 63% in 2006. The last time this kind of viewership growth occurred in a new medium was when the television was first introduced in the early 1950s.</p>
<p>There are several special interest sites that are driving significant audience and advertising revenue growth by producing original video programming and by showcasing quality user video. Two good examples are <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://community.freeskier.com/">Freeskier Magazine</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.surfline.com">Surfline.com</a>. The metrics these sites are generating in number of streams viewed, time on site and user engagement are eye popping. In addition the <span class="caps">CEO&#39;</span>s of both companies, Bradford Fayfield of Freeskier parent company Storm Mountain Publishing and Jonno Welles of Surfline, have told me that advertisers are rapidly buying up their video related inventory.</p>
<p>We have been producing a considerable amount of video via <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.lightreading.com/section.asp?section_id=228,229,230,231,232,274,331,422&section_name=Light+Reading+TV">Light Reading TV</a>and our video programming on <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com">The TechWeb Online Network</a>. We are seeing significant traffic, with stream downloads in the hundreds of thousands as well as deep audience engagement. Our advertising demand is pacing with the audience growth as well.</p>
<p>Ok so obvious huh? Online video is the future, we should all be investing and will all make money. Right? Well as usual...it&#39;s a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Video without question is and will be a major application on the web. Audiences are adopting online video in a wide range of formats. Short clips, long form, high quality, low quality &quot;shakey cam&quot;, user driven and more. The advertising and revenue side is lagging however. There are a couple of reasons for this. First is the lack of a standard ad format. Most marketers don&#39;t have pre roll or video advertising appropriate for the web. As a result most online video advertising is from the same large scale advertisers, who do have pre roll, in each market.</p>
<p>The other challenge is the lack of a common currency to price and value online video advertising. Do you  price value by the number of streams viewed? By a sponsorship model that values the brand and demographics of a site, as opposed to some sort of traffic metrics? Or performance metrics that demonstrate a specific level of audience engagement?</p>
<p>The reality is that money and the standard currency to price appropriately will rapdily follow the audience in online video. As noted in previous posts, my theory on Google&#39;s buying <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is based on Google developing ad sense for video. In other words contextual ad serving of a standard ad unit (not only video ads) against video searched and viewed. There are other companies like <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.brightcove.com/">BrightCove</a>,already offering video publishing and ad serving systems for online sites.</p>
<p>Video is rapidly becoming a standard online and will only get larger. Video is the new black. It needs to become a staple in the wardrobe of any serious online media brand.,</p>
