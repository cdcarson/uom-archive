<div class="content">
  <p>In the 1970&#39;s psychologists defined EQ or Emotional Intelligence, as the ability or capacity to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of one&#39;s self, and of others. Our EQ, or Emotional Quotient, is the measure of our Emotional Intelligence. The theory was that IQ and experience were not always accurate predictors of success in life or business but that EQ could be. Further study over next 3 decades have proven this theory to be correct. Studies suggest that EQ is twice as important as either intellect or experience as an attribute of successful business leaders.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a big believer in IQ/EQ and have used the theories, testing and diagnostics that help to define these attributes in hiring and developing people and in my own professional development for well over a decade. I would add however that there is another level of intelligence that is critical in business. In media  let&#39;s define this as MQ; Media Quotient or Media Intelligence.</p>
<p>MQ is the ability or capacity to perceive, assess, and understand audiences and marketers media interests and habits in uniquely powerful and scalable ways. MQ is not about predicting the future of media. It&#39;s about knowing the future when you see it and being able to act on it.</p>
<p>In previous posts I&#39;ve touched on the two revolutions in media in the last 100 years; television and the internet. While I can&#39;t speak to the television revolution I can to the internet revolution and without question the leaders that are driving this era of media have extraordinary MQ.</p>
<p>We tend to talk about very vertical skills in media from content to sales to audience development to finance. What we don&#39;t focus on enough is also hiring people with MQ, developing MQ in our people and creating environments that attract and retain high MQ talent. All easier said than done. So how about you? What&#39;s your MQ? What&#39;s your company&#39;s MQ? What are you doing to develop more MQ in your business?,</p>
