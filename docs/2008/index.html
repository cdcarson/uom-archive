        Are we in a recession? If so when did it start? How long will it last? What brought it on? Are all segments of the economy suffering? Why does technology seem to be uneffected?

For instance the latest statistics show the majority of wealth in the United States, over 71%, is controlled by less than 10% of the US population. The same sort of statistical bias is true in technology purchasing or in...
