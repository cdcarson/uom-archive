        The latest controversy between AOL and Michael Arrington is a fascinating story. Strong personalities with strong points of view, editorial ethics, management missteps, and big company culture versus small company passion make this a particularly juicy drama.
Arrington has made an ultimatum to AOL:...

        A newspaper was always so much more to its readers than a printed page full of news. It was the place that provided local, regional, national and international news.

Lots of folks refer to multiples, of cash flow or revenue or whatever, as a way of determining future value.   You project the expected future performance of the company, factor in the cost of c...
