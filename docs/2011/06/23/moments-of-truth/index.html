<div class="content">
  <p>In the early 1980&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Carlzon" target="_blank">Jan Carlson</a> took over SAS airlines. The company was in poor shape and Carlson set  about to turn it around. He boiled the business down to a series of what  he called &quot;moments of truth&quot;. These moments  were touch points where key interactions with customers or employees  took place. He defined being greeted at curb-side check in,  met and served by a ticket agent and the cleanliness of the airplane  as moments of truth, that were opportunities to either make or break the business. He went on to define similar moments with managers interactions with employees. I read his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moments-Truth-Jan-Carlzon/dp/0060915803" target="_blank">&quot;Moments of Truth&quot;</a> in the late 80&#39;s and it had a profound impact on me.</p>
<p>Moments  of truth can be hard to focus on during times of change like we&#39;ve had  in the media industry over the last decade. The speed and metric based  nature of the Internet can also make it difficult to identify and  monitor the moments in your business. Perhaps this is why it&#39;s time to focus on the moments of truth in media now. A colleague of mine brought &quot;Moments of Truth&quot; up in a meeting recently and it got me to thinking about its applicability in today&#39;s media business.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Know the bell of truth when you hear it ring. </strong>We  are awash in data. Never before have we had so much data on our  audiences, our brands our products and our employees. After more than a  decade of a Wizard of Oz belief in search; generated by a  mysterious and all powerful algorithm that regularly changes and no one  understands, a socially reticent, Harvard dropout reminded us that it's  the connection with people that matters. The simple moment of truth  about the social layer is it allows people to connect with their  interests through people they respect, like and know. Dorothy taught us  this in 1936, exposing the Wizard of Oz for what he was. Easy for me to  note this now. I've gotten as caught up in gaming Google as anyone. The  reality is though SEO isn't a moment of truth. It's a powerful and  appropriate mechanism to assist with discoverability on the Internet.  Audiences are people and people are social beings however. Not data  points reflected by algorithms sitting on servers in the silicon  valley.</li>
    <li><strong>Spread Sheets and Deal Terms. </strong>The astounding level of metrics we can derive from the web can take on a life of it's own. From  CPC to CTR's to CPA and CPL the acronyms reflect a phase of deal term  and spread sheet selling. These metrics are important and demonstrate  the performance based value of online media.They do not replace however,  the need to understand a clients business, create proposals that  reflect this understanding and deliver marketing as a service that  assures marketers receive ongoing value. Again here this cannot be  automated. The moment of truth with your marketing customer does not  reside on a spread sheet. It is contained in your ability to understand  their business and create successful programs that will benefit their  marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Presence Matters. Always. </strong>People cannot be inspired, led or  managed via email. Responses to surveys about employee attitudes or customer interests tell  you only so much. People respond to people. Leadership and management is  tough. It requires time, patience and emotional resilience. It also  requires presence. There is no greater moment of truth than when you  meet with customers or employees. It is this moment that is the  lifeblood of the media business. It is also the lifeblood of any  business.</li>
</ul>
What moments of truth do you see in your business? Are they changing? How do you track them?,
