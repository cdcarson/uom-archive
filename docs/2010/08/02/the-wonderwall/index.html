<div class="content">
  <p><strong>&quot;<em>I said maybe, you&#39;re the one to save me. And after all, you&#39;re my wonderwall&quot;.</em></strong><em>   </em>The chorus from the hit song &quot;Wonderwall&quot; by the band Oasis seems to have been written for today&#39;s daily newspaper industry.  <em> </em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/finally-some-hints-about-how-much-the-new-york-times-online-paywall-will-cost-2010-8">The New York Times </a>went public this week with their plans for a paywall starting in January 2011.  <a href="http://www.editorsweblog.org/newspaper/2010/01/financial_times_paywall_finally_pays_off.php">The Financial Times</a> an early pioneer in creating paywalls for online content claims that content revenue will surpass advertising revenue this year.  <a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2010/07/20/paywalls-are-dumb-statistics-prove/">Rupert Murdoch&#39;s experiements</a> with online paywalls have gotten mixed reviews. Tough to articulate a 60% drop in traffic as a positive.</p>
<p>Different than all other print media, daily newspapers have always been marketed at impulse buy prices. To this day $1.00 is the average newsstand price for a daily newspaper.  This low-cost/high value tradition for daily newspapers creates a particularly challenging dynamic as they look to create paywalls for their online versions. Newspaper businesses continue to claim that readers have always “paid” for their news by purchasing a newspaper. This is false; readers pay for the convenience of having the content delivered — advertisers have footed the bill for content creation. </p>
<p>So now daily newspapers have to convince you that the content value is actually higher than you thought. Or they need to appeal to your sense of fairness, that based on a changing media landscape, you need to pay more. Trying to convince people to pay more; or pay at all, for content they have gotten for a relatively low, or no, price simply doesn&#39;t scale. I&#39;d argue that other than perhaps The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the New York Times, there are few-if any-daily newspapers that will be able to make this transition. And it&#39;s not entirely clear what the business on the other side of this transition will look like either.  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aKnLb7Zqtfv4">Murdoch&#39;s</a> sabre rattling with Google and other search engines is not without logic. In the early 1980&#39;s people laughed at the idea of paying for television. 30 years later cable television rules the airwaves. Will there come a time when carriage fee models emerge online as they did in cable? It&#39;s possible. I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath however.</p>
<p>Perhaps Oasis was writing about the newspaper business after all. The next verse of Wonderwall: <strong>&quot;<em>Today was going to be the day. But they&#39;ll never throw it back to you. By now you should&#39;ve somehow realized what you&#39;re not to do. I don&#39;t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now&quot;. </em></strong>,</p>
