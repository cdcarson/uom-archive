				<![CDATA[Kudos to Linda McCutcheon: <span class="caps">SVP </span>of New Media at <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nielsenbusinessmedia.com/index.html">Nielsen Media</a> for the line. Linda was a panelist for two of our sessions at the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliosummit.com/program/wg_ex.htm">Executive Management</a> work sessions at the Folio Summit last week, where online video was a very hot topic.

Video is indeed one of the hottest topics amongst online media companies today. Should you be investing? Experimenting? What's the right formula, short clips, long form, user driven, original programming? What's the right business model? What are the implications for content teams? Should you just give cameras to editors? What's the right advertising model? What's the right sales model?

When in doubt, always follow the audience. Research firm <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.emarketer.com/">eMarketer</a> projects that by 2011 more than 85% of the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Internet population will consume Internet video, up from roughly 63% in 2006. The last time this kind of viewership growth occurred in a new medium was when the television was first introduced in the early 1950s.

There are several special interest sites that are driving significant audience and advertising revenue growth by producing original video programming and by showcasing quality user video. Two good examples are <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://community.freeskier.com/">Freeskier Magazine</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.surfline.com">Surfline.com</a>. The metrics these sites are generating in number of streams viewed, time on site and user engagement are eye popping. In addition the <span class="caps">CEO'</span>s of both companies, Bradford Fayfield of Freeskier parent company Storm Mountain Publishing and Jonno Welles of Surfline, have told me that advertisers are rapidly buying up their video related inventory.

We have been producing a considerable amount of video via <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.lightreading.com/section.asp?section_id=228,229,230,231,232,274,331,422&amp;section_name=Light+Reading+TV">Light Reading TV</a>and our video programming on <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com">The TechWeb Online Network</a>. We are seeing significant traffic, with stream downloads in the hundreds of thousands as well as deep audience engagement. Our advertising demand is pacing with the audience growth as well.

Ok so obvious huh? Online video is the future, we should all be investing and will all make money. Right? Well as usual...it's a bit more complicated.

Video without question is and will be a major application on the web. Audiences are adopting online video in a wide range of formats. Short clips, long form, high quality, low quality "shakey cam", user driven and more. The advertising and revenue side is lagging however. There are a couple of reasons for this. First is the lack of a standard ad format. Most marketers don't have pre roll or video advertising appropriate for the web. As a result most online video advertising is from the same large scale advertisers, who do have pre roll, in each market.

The other challenge is the lack of a common currency to price and value online video advertising. Do you  price value by the number of streams viewed? By a sponsorship model that values the brand and demographics of a site, as opposed to some sort of traffic metrics? Or performance metrics that demonstrate a specific level of audience engagement?

The reality is that money and the standard currency to price appropriately will rapdily follow the audience in online video. As noted in previous posts, my theory on Google's buying <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is based on Google developing ad sense for video. In other words contextual ad serving of a standard ad unit (not only video ads) against video searched and viewed. There are other companies like <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.brightcove.com/">BrightCove</a>,already offering video publishing and ad serving systems for online sites.

Video is rapidly becoming a standard online and will only get larger. Video is the new black. It needs to become a staple in the wardrobe of any serious online media brand.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Front Seat of the Roller Coaster		</title>

				<![CDATA[This past week I was a guest speaker at the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliosummit.com/index.htm">Folio Publishing Summit</a> in Florida co-chairing the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliosummit.com/program/wg_ex.htm">Executive Management working sessions</a> with Bill Holiber President of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.usnews.com/">US News &amp; World Report</a>. This is my second time speaking at a Folio event and both times have been fascinating and valuable experiences for me. In the revolution from media 1.0 to media 2.0, I have been lucky enough to be on the forefront of the process as we evolve print centric businesses to become online centric, multi-platform brands and media networks. I've been in the front seat of the roller coaster if you will

Certainly my company <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.cmp.com"><span class="caps">CMP</span></a> has been one of the leaders in <span class="caps">B2B </span>media, transforming from being a print centric publisher to an online, live event and business services centric model, with best in class print over the last 3 years.

The Folio Summit provided a fantastic opportunity to gauge where the industry is in the evolution/revolution and what innovative moves various companies are making. One of the highlights of the conference was the keynote given by <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://hanleywood.com/?page=home">Hanley Wood</a> CEO Frank Anton. Standing onstage with a single power point slide with his company name and logo, Frank talked about the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliomag.com/2008/b-b-s-10-deadliest-sins">10 deadly sins</a> of <span class="caps">B2B </span>media companies. In an age of false prophets (especially in this time of media revolution) Anton's speech was remarkable. Built on common sense with an eye towards innovation, risk taking, embracing the future, while also staying true to your culture and values, his talk stood out amongst anything else presented at the conference. By far.

The conference brought into stark relief where the various publishing companies stand today in harnessing the changes brought on by a media 2.0 world. Don Tenant editorial director of Computerworld and Infoworld at <span class="caps">IDG </span><a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.foliomag.com/2008/print-not-heart-and-soul-magazine-brands">talked about the move from print to online.</a>. With all due respect to the Folio journalist who wrote the piece on the presentation, Tenant's comments are so dated in the technology <span class="caps">B2B </span>media market as to be laughable.

I also got the chance to spend time with Rita Burke: President of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.zinio.com/#">Zinio</a> as well as Michael Biggerstaff (great name btw): Chief Inspiration Officer of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nxtbook.com/">Nxtbook Media</a>. Digital edition technology, long thought to be a major shift and opportunity for print publishers, has been very slow to gain material traction. New hybrid, technologies being developed by both these companies however, blending digital delivery with web and mobile features, may bring new life to this platform.

Lastly thanks to the folks at NxtBook and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.runnersworld.com/">Runners World</a> for sponsoring a fun run 5k race at 6:30 Friday morning. Bit rough given the timing but it was a blast. Ran a respectable-for me at least-28:00 minutes. Who the heck brought in the ringer who ran the 19:00 minute time though?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Surfing, Puppies, Iraq and Editorial...Oh My!		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2008/02/17/surfing-puppies-iraq-and-editorial-oh-my/</link>

				<![CDATA[First off a brief shout out to the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.surfline.com">Surfline.com</a> crew, <span class="caps">CEO</span> Jonno Wells, Kevin and Robin, who invited me to go surfing Saturday at a private island 50 miles off the coast of Newport beach California. We saw grey whales, dolphins, seals, birds of all sorts and incredible waves. Great time. Especially appreciated that the crew didn't tell me the comment from the one local surfer we met until we were back in the boat. "Yea I rarely see other people surf here. Maybe it's the sharks".

There has been a ton of buzz generated by the new owner of Tribune Company, Sam Zell's , <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDy7vn7-LX4">comments on editorial</a> given during a news room meeting at The Orlando Sentinel. In the last week people have described Zell's comments to me as refreshing, insightful, bold and necessary. I have also had them described as inane, clueless, out of touch and uninformed. From my perspective they are all accurate

Editorial departments have a mandate to serve their audiences. They are not disconnected from the business however. The web makes transparent the impact that editorial has on audiences. We don't have to wonder if there is a reaction to the content we are putting out. We have immediate metrics that let us know. This "listening" to the audience is something that can be transfered from online to print and back again. It takes strong editorial leadership however that isn't afraid to challenge the status quo. Many print editorial operations have been woefully out of touch with their audiences for years. Subscription trends, occasional letters to the editor or quarterly reader research provide limited if any actionable data for content teams. The web has changed all of that. The web has ignited a transfer of advertising revenue from print as well as exposing the lack of connection that many print editorial operations have with their audiences.

The answer? Print editorial operations must be combined with online. Clearly content must be tailored for the platform but the days of having two, separate editorial operations, one print, one online, both generating content for a single brand, are over.

Last thought. Sam Zell made his fortune in real estate development. The media business is littered with the ashes of smart, wealthy people who made fortunes in other industries, only to see them become small fortunes in the media business. Zell may be brilliant. I fear he really doesn't understand what he has gotten himself into however. Only time will tell. I hope someone keeps video taping his "F Bomb" outbursts though. He certainly won't be boring.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[We are quickly reaching an inflection point for online traffic data and the way web media is valued. The volume of information on web traffic has created massive pools of data with surprisingly limited analysis or insights that support media buyers or sellers. In some cases the numbers are hard to fathom. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://blog.compete.com/2007/10/30/top-50-websites-domains-digg-youtube-flickr-facebook/">130 million unique visitors?</a>. Really? The challenge is that the web exposes the inherent flaw in Nielsen Research. Small sample sizes that strain credulity when they are lifted to project a total audience. The cozy relationship that created a standard currency based on Nielsen data for the buying and selling of television time,simply won't work for the web.<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/04/63080"> Frankly its under attack</a> for television, as Nielsen attempts to make the final shifts from paper journals to automated people meter systems.

As the web matures into a mainstream media ad agencies are struggling to make money. While the web offers extraordinary capabilities for targeting, contextual and conversational marketing most agencies talk quality and buy quantity. Without a standard currency most broad based agencies struggle to find real scale and in turn profits in online ad buying. So reach=revenue? Or will we see the web fulfill the promise of one to one and conversational marketing?

There are several web research and analytic efforts that are starting to spot patterns in audience behavior, interests and traffic trends that hold promise in providing marketers actionable insights. They are also starting to leverage the web to tap the wisdom of crowds and develop predictive analysis. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.umbrialistens.com/">Umbria</a> as well as <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nielsenbuzzmetrics.com/products">Buzz Metrics</a> are harnessing web analytics to provide insights into brands, consumer behavior and buying interests that may well lead to new methods for valuing web media.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[The role of editing is being transformed in media 2.0 companies today. The job of refining the work of journalists, crafting headlines and packaging the flow of content in a given issue is still an important part of the print content process. In online media however the throughput from writer to audience is far more direct and immediate. Some of this is driven by the always on nature of the web. Frequency in online media has become an irrelevant concept. The other driver is the read/write nature of today's online experience. The role of editing has become a web development role. The visual narrative online is structured to provide compelling applications that allow audiences to customize, engage and co-create content. The goal is engagement and developers are now actively "editing" the experience for online audiences. Today developers must play a core role on content teams.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Like beauty this may be in the eye of the beholder at this phase of the media business. From meetings with media stock analysts and investors to industry events like  the Folio Conferences and Price Waterhouse Coopers Media Outlook this is one of the most frequent questions on everyone's mind...is there life in print? The question is not as simple as it appears.

There has clearly been a decrease in advertiser demand for print over the last several years. This is most acute with <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/31/newspapers-advertising-media-biz-media-cx_lh_0831newspapers.html">daily newspapers</a>, some consumer print and in various portions of <span class="caps">B2B </span>media. The data is even more dramatic when you factor that The New York Times,  as well as other newspaper groups, release their results with <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://publishing2.com/2007/07/26/new-york-times-continues-to-conceal-decline-in-print-advertising-revenue/">print and online revenues combined</a>. In other words the growth in online revenues is masking an even steeper decline in print advertising revenues.

The data would suggest that the rapid advertising decline is following the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/30/AR2006103000357.html">decline in circulation for newspapers</a>. The hard data and certainly anecdotal data would suggest that there has been a massive fall off in print newspaper readership. There is more to the story however.

The revenue calculus for daily newspapers, like most print, is based on a fairly simple formula of reach=revenue. The higher the reach, the higher the page rate. There have long been rumors in media circles about paid print brands inflating their rate bases in order to drive higher page rates. In 2003 there were a series of investigations into the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DE103FF934A2575BC0A9629C8B63">rate bases of various newspapers and magazines</a>. Turns out the rumors were true. The ranges varied but on average the offending titles had overstated their rate bases by about 20%. Even before these adjustments, the reality is that the reach of daily newspapers was not nearly as large as most people would think. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nytimes.com/">The NY Times</a> has a daily circulation of 1.2 million. This in a town with over 8.2 million residents. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.latimes.com/">The LA Time</a>s has a daily circulation of 815k in a county with over 10 million residents. Since the advent of television daily newspapers have not demonstrably changed from these ratios of reach and coverage.

Look, I'm no print apologist. Quite the opposite. If we could stop chopping down trees and bypass the postal services I would do it tomorrow. Online media is without question the fastest growing revenue base for my company as it is with most media companies today. The reality is however there is still very healthy audience demand for print that doesn't synch with the decline in advertiser demand. There are several reasons for this.

1.) <strong>Print isn't cool right now</strong>. Media businesses, ad agencies and marketers aren't focused on print, as its not popular. If you want to see buzzkill in action, watch a marketer or agency give a presentation to a client on the need for print as part of a marketing program.

2.) <strong>Bean Counters</strong>. The vast majority of media companies with rapidly declining print revenues have changed from privately held to public companies or been sold to private equity ownership over the last 5-7 years. The Tribune Company as an example has had no clear plan other than to attempt to save their way to greatness. They have done literally nothing with any of their print products to redefine or reposition them in an online centric world. To watch the newspaper I grew up reading, The LA Times, become a confused-don't know if we're international, regional, local- unfocused mess, with no consistent point of view, no editorial direction and no rudder whatsoever was a shame. Again the only clear strategy has been cost savings. In addition watching the majority of daily newspaper web efforts, which for the most part are read only Web 1.0 sites at best, has been laughable. At the same time there have been examples of great innovation with daily newspapers in other areas, notably in Europe with brands like <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian</a>.

3.) <strong>There is a new center of gravity.</strong> Every 100 years or so there is a legitimate revolution in media, that forces all other media to redefine their value. Television was the first clear example of this. The Internet is the second. Print can no longer ignore that the Web is the center of gravity in media and as such print needs to be redefined with this clear understanding.

So...is print dead? From my vantage point this can only be answered brand by brand and market by market. Print will never return to the center of gravity. That being said there is life in the platform <strong>as long as</strong> print publishers have a clear vision of how to redefine their print offerings to assure that they continue to innovate in what is now an online centric world.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[The move by <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/02/yahoo_to_reject.html" target="_blank">Microsoft to acquire Yahoo</a> has repeatedly been referred to as a bid for controlling web traffic versus Google. While clearly the combined entity would aggregate a far larger audience than <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.msn.com"><span class="caps">MSN</span></a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> do individually this is actually a battle for something far larger. It's the battle for control of the advertising operating system.

Microsoft was built on a simple yet powerful premise. Focus on controlling, then scaling standards. While the aggregate audience on the web long ago reached the tipping point of a mass audience, the real scale will come from controlling the way the web itself is monetized. Microsoft understands this viscerally. So does Google. Its still very early in this battle. Regardless of your pov it will be fun to watch.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Shift happens. There are several overarching trends that are driving fundamental change in the world we live in and affecting the we think about, interact with and react to media. While there is an endless supply of books, papers, lectures and research reports analyzing these trends, most would agree that the trends revolve around some version of these four: digitization (the internet), globalization, localization and fragmentation. From a media point of view, there have been two revolutions that changed everything, affecting all aspects of life, business and culture. The first was television and the second the internet. And in the internet revolution, as we are all learning, we are just now experiencing the second wave.

The main driver of the second wave has been the evolution of the web from a passive media platform to an active media platform. This was and remains the fundamental shift that ultimately represents the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. At a base level this shift was the change in the web from a read only medium to a read/write medium. The web became a software application and this now application based media provided significantly deeper user engagement as well as measurable marketing performance. This new active media platform also presents enormous opportunities for marketers, given the metrics, ability to communicate with and engage with customers at far deep levels than any passive media could ever dream of. Applications like next generation search, social networking, blogging and more sophisticated online registration and interaction were all born in this phase and now dominate web traffic and interaction today. One of the other outcomes of this transition has been that for the first time, media could take advantage of network math. The theory of network math is that for every additional user on the network the value for any individual user of the network goes up.

All obvious points right? Well the impact of this shift has not been so obvious. This second wave has created massive turbulence in the currency exchange and valuation in media. Traditional <span class="caps">CPM </span>metrics in media are under significant challenge as <span class="caps">CPC, CPL </span>and any number of new outcome based metrics are driving the new economy of media. The real challenge for media companies, regardless of where they are in the Media 1.0 to Media 2.0 spectrum, is how to manage these new evolving currencies and adapt their business models accordingly.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Jeff-Klein.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-896" title="Jeff Klein" src="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Jeff-Klein.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a>Jeffrey S. Klein is a seasoned and highly regarded media executive and respected lecturer. Trained as both a lawyer and a journalist, he has more than 20 years of experience operating newspaper, television, magazine and internet businesses.

From 2001 to 2006, he was president and CEO of 101communications, a market leading B2B publisher serving the Information Technology segment, a company Klein co-founded with the backing of a Chicago-based private equity firm, The Frontenac Company. 101 grew from three employees at its founding in 1999 to 220 employees, operating 25 web sites, publishing nine magazines and conducting more than 40 trade conferences per year; collectively more than $50 million in revenue.  In April 2006, Klein and Frontenac sold 101 to 1105 Media, a multimedia publishing and trade show company where Klein is currently Chairman of the Board. Before being named 101’s CEO, Klein served as COO for several years. When he took over as CEO, he executed a dramatic turnaround, overseeing a financial and organizational restructuring in the face of a major technology recession, the dotcom bubble burst, and 9/11. Turnarounds were not new to Klein.  In the mid-nineties, as CEO of California Community News Corp. he took the Times Mirror owned $25 million community newspaper company from the red to the black in less than a year.

Klein is one of the few traditional media executives who  successfully transitioned early on to the internet publishing model. At 101, when Klein started as CEO in 2001, the company had about 5% of its revenues from web products, but by the time he sold the company, internet revenues had grown to nearly 20%, along with a much higher percentage of total profits because of their high margin. 101 was one of the first magazine companies to publish electronic editions, use RSS feeds and hold profitable webinars.

In 2006, Klein was named to the “Folio Forty,” the list in Folio: of the 40 most influential people in the magazine industry. In 2004, he was selected as one of the three most innovative CEOs in trade publishing by B2B's Media Business Magazine.

Klein spent 15 years with the Los Angeles Times and Times Mirror in senior management positions, including Senior Vice President and General Manager, News and Senior Vice President, Consumer Marketing. He also served as president of two large regional editions of the newspaper. Under his marketing leadership, the Los Angeles Times became the largest circulation metropolitan daily in the United States. While serving in a corporate position at Times Mirror, he also was responsible for two company network-affiliate TV stations.

Klein began his career as a lawyer, first in the entertainment industry representing movie stars and production companies, and later on behalf of the Los Angeles Times as a specialist in First Amendment issues. He has taught media law and media business strategy for many years at the University of Southern California Annenberg School.  In 2011 he is teaching “the business of journalism” at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. His early law experience included work for Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt on the Kemeny Commission investigating the accident at Three Mile Island.

For ten years, he also wrote a weekly consumer law column for the Los Angeles Times. Klein's articles have also appeared in the Columbia Journalism Review, the Online Journalism Review, and the Los Angeles Times Book Review. For several years, he wrote a regular column called Executive Perspective for Folio:, the magazine of magazine management. He writes a very occasional blog which be found at <a href=" http://themediabiz.blogspot.com/">themediabiz.blogspot.com</a>. He has spoken at numerous industry events about marketing, management and leadership and been quoted in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and trade publications as well as having appeared on CNN, ABC’s Nightline and many other radio and television programs.

Klein is active in the community, having served on various non-profit boards, including the United Way, Foundation for American Communications, and the Alliance for the Arts. The Anti-Defamation League awarded him its Community Service Award, and the March of Dimes awarded him and his wife Karyn, a “Premiere Parents of the year” award. He is the past chairman of the board of directors of MEND, Meet Each Need with Dignity, the largest privately funded antipoverty agency in the San Fernando Valley, and led its recent $8.5 million capital campaign.  Currently he serves on the advisory board of the Kravis Leadership Institute, the Board of Trustees of Claremont McKenna College and is “executive in residence” at USC’s Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy.

Klein received his master's degree in journalism from Columbia University, his law degree from Stanford University, and his bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, from Claremont McKenna College. He is married and has three daughters.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Who Do You Trust? 10 Things to Consider About Vetting in the Age of Social Media		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/?p=992</link>

				<![CDATA[15 minutes after the first Tweet stating that the US military had found and killed Osama Bin Laden CNN’s Wolf Blitzer was still struggling on air. Clearly he and his staff were seeing the tweet stream but Blitzer could only react to what we were all reading as he and his extensive news organization could not vet the accuracy of the information streaming across Twitter. After an excruciating amount of time where Blitzer was forced to repeatedly explain that they couldn’t verify the reports, he confirmed what everyone had known for 20 minutes that indeed Bin Laden had been killed. This and other recent examples demonstrate how rapidly social media has changed how we get our news and how we share it. Today it’s fair to say that Twitter breaks news and television covers it.

Social media however is just that. It’s social. While news organizations use social media, citizen “journalists” and “reporters” fill the vast majority of Twitter streams and Facebook posts. Is Jon Bon Jovi dead or alive? When did Joe Paterno die? What exactly did Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum say at the latest stop on the Republican presidential primary tour?

Vetting the accuracy of the information on social media is challenging to say the least. Company and personal brands can be enhanced and extended via social media. They can also be destroyed. We will be addressing these topics at our panel discussion at the SXSW Conference:<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/search?q=vetting+in+the+age+of+social+media" target="_blank">“Vetting in the Age of Social Media. Who Do You Trust?”</a>  If you’ll be attending SXSW this year please join us. In the interim here are 10 things to consider about vetting in the age of social:

1.       <strong>Brand Matters</strong>. Ironically the rise of social media has driven a renewed interest in branded content. People and brands you can trust and that you rely on for your news and perspective. Regardless of the level of importance of the news, people want to trust their sources.

2.       <strong>Know the Difference Between Gossip and News</strong>. The water cooler is digital today. Don’t overreact to fun, gossipy information that is passed around on social networks and hold it to the same standards as news.

3.       <strong>Beware of False Prophets</strong>. In any gold rush there are legions of consultants and advisors that appear, providing expert analysis and advice on the trends shaping the market. Social media is rife with them. They will give you social media advice for a fee about developing trust, creating followers, curating content and generating “likes” and “recommendations”. Some of this advice can be valuable. Much of it is not.

<strong>4.       </strong><strong>Trust is built over time and erased in a moment in the digital world</strong>. The "trust wars" tend to take place in public with commenters taking sides. <strong></strong>

5.       <strong>Trust has become tiered. </strong>Do you trust the author, the brand and transparent relationships to the topic covered? All three need to be aligned and reinforce one another.

6.       <strong>Brand </strong><strong>to Brandividual</strong><strong>.</strong> Trust can follow the trusted source and leave the brand behind

7.       <strong>The Shift from Search to Social</strong>.  What you read on the issue is increasingly built on following trusted links from social networks, not SEO based discovery.

8.       <strong>Beware</strong> <strong>Anonymous</strong>. Automated and autonomous commenting on articles has been over-gamed to have little meaning.

9.       <strong>Community Engagement</strong>. Writers have to work as hard at building social communities as they do at creating content. They need to engage the audience throughout the story's life.

10.   <strong>The Role of Video</strong>. Video is emerging as the favored trusted source. You can see an interview taking place which is hard to fake as opposed to text which is fungible.

From journalist to Media Company to consumer, the impact of social media has been profound. How to manage the extraordinary power while also assuring the authenticity continues to be a challenge however. Let me know your thoughts on vetting in the age of social.

				<![CDATA["What is hip? Tell me tell me...Do you think you know?  Is it the clothes that you wear? Or the style of your hair? As you're striving to find the right road, there's one thing you should know: What's hip today might become passé".  The legendary rock band Tower of Power posed the question "What is Hip" in their hit song of the same name.  Marketer, media and brandividual alike struggle to answer this question today as clout is being redefined by the digital era.

				<![CDATA[The media business has had a love-hate relationship with demand generation. During the "golden age" of the 1960's advertising took in an artistic sensibility that had little if anything to do with response. "Branding" was the focus and the cliche' of "half of my advertising dollar is wasted, I just don't know which half" was a cliche' for a reason as it had a modicum of truth to it.  Given that media didn't want to be any more responsible for driving response than the ad agency did, most demand generation was handled by direct response agencies and list rental or infommercial companies.  The advent of Internet based media changed this forever.

Today demand generation has been embraced by media and marketer]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Biggest 10 Year Old I&#039;ve Ever Seen		</title>

				<![CDATA[Earlier this week I attended a dinner at the Corporate Ecoforum. The event, founded and produced by our friend MR Rangaswami, software and venture veteran and cofounder of SandHill Group, draws together senior executives from across functions and industries to review successful state-of-the-art eco strategies and their implementation. Eric Schmidt the CEO of Google gave the keynote speech, where he presented nothing less than an outline for a renewable energy policy for the United States. Fascinating and thought provoking talk to be sure. The timing of the speech was all the more enhanced by the fact that the date fell on Google's 10th anniversary and was days after the release of their Chrome browser. After his speech, as luck would have it, Eric was seated next to me for dinner and I got the chance for an extended conversation with him.

I had met Eric a few times 10 years or so ago when he was running Novell and have always been impressed with his calm, clear analytic skills and thought process. He listens, thinks and then speaks. An increasingly rare phenomenon today.

We talked about  technology in general as well as media. His grasp of media trends beyond online is impressive. It's clear in talking with him that he increasingly views Google as an organizing media brand, as opposed to one that is simply cannibalizing all other media.

Given his background it wasn't surprising that he has a deep understanding of the brands and services we offer at <a href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/">TechWeb.</a> I was pleasantly surprised however by his level of awareness and understanding of the successful transformation from CMP Media to TechWeb we have made in the last 2 years.

He asked me who I viewed as TechWeb's competition today. I outlined the traditional, new and nontraditional media companies and applications we currently view as competitive. He thoughtfully nodded his head making some specific comments about individual companies and which ones he felt had made the "transition". I then noted that Google should also be on this list. He rocked back, smiled and said "well I guess that's true at some level".

I asked him how he felt about the launch of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/09/video_taking_go.html;jsessionid=J40NBT3PKUDKUQSNDLOSKHSCJUNN2JVN?queryText=chrome">Chrome</a>, Google's new browser introduced the previous week. He said that the beta version of the product had exceeded his expectations. He didn't think the product would be this far along in it's launch version. I let him know that across all of the TechWeb online sites Chrome went from 0-5% in browser share in the first 48 hours of it's release. Given the size and the technical depth of our audiences this is a major statement. He went on to say that their goal is to grow Chrome's share of the bowser market to the level that it diminishes <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx">Microsoft's IE</a> to 50% or less. " This would break Microsoft's stranglehold and significantly change the game". I asked him if he felt the launch of Chrome is the acknowledgement that the desktop as we know it is now moving into the cloud. Again he smiled and said "we sure hope so".

The dinner ended with a birthday cake to celebrate Google's 10 year anniversary. As Eric blew out the candles the reality of Google's size, clout and relative youth really hit me. Biggest 10 year old I've ever seen. By far.  I wouldn't suggest here that I know Eric well. It was interesting to spend some one on one time with him however and to see the changes from his days at Novell. He is self aware and has a profound and respectful understanding of the role that Google plays in today's world. He appears to understand the responsibility that comes with the position that Google now enjoys. I may be projecting here but as he moved on to speak with others I could sense a bit of the Shakespearian "heavy hangs the head that wears the crown".

Quick shout out to one of the true pioneers in technology and marketing who was also at the dinner, <a href="http://www.regis.com/">Regis McKenna</a>. Regis as most people know was very influential in the founding and marketing strategy of Apple, Compaq and a host of other technology companies. In the early 90's Regis wrote a piece for Harvard Business Review titled "<a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/hbsp/hbr/articles/article.jsp?ml_action=get-article&amp;articleID=91108&amp;ml_page=1&amp;ml_subscriber=true">Marketing is Everything</a>" that defined the future of technology and marketing. The article literally changed the way I looked at media and marketing and served as a manifesto for a generation of technology, media and marketing execs. It was great to reconnect with Regis who continues to sit on boards of various technology companies as well as advise the technology elite.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Chrome, Cloud &amp; Convergence		</title>

				<![CDATA[My recent post on Google's launch of Chrome generated a lot of discussion. My "unofficial editor" David Berlind (as a journalist I make a great media exec!) rightfully noted my referring to Chrome's features; speed, multitasking and advanced security, as open source features was misleading. These desktop operating system and application like features represent the next level of innovation for web browsers. Chrome will now be part of the open source community however and this will allow for the sort of adoption and adaption that we've seen with open source operating systems like Linux. Heck, they knew what I meant!

If you haven't yet checked Chrome out you can download the in depth analysis <em>InformationWeek</em> produced this week.<span> <span><a href="http://www.informationweekreports.com/login.jhtml?id=&amp;doc_id=210500091&amp;_requestid=147181">Download the Report Here</a></span>.</span> (registration is required). It's fair to say that Google has work left to do. This is a beta version of software that has bugs, flaws and is lacking some features. Google also made a strategic blunder with their <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/google/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=210500008">original terms of service</a> agreement, since amended. The fact remains however that the launch of Chrome is a game changer and as has been widely noted represents a significant challenge to Microsoft's operating system business. Chrome will also accelerate the shift of the desktop as we know it into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud.</a>

As <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/9/3/nothing-like-a-little-chrome.html#comments">Chris Carson</a> commented, Google would be well served to continue to push functionality into the cloud with Chrome rather than emulate the hard drive centricity of traditional desktop apps. My belief is that users will want the ability to use email on and offline for the near term and Chrome will provide this functionality. In an increasingly "always on" world however this will become a moot point. My regular American Airlines flights between LAX and JFK are now offering internet access as my colleague Fritz Nelson <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/08/air_blog_a_go_g.html;jsessionid=RIP51HY4JWKZMQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN?queryText=fritz+nelson">demonstrated</a>.  It's only a matter of time until this is the norm.

Thanks to <a href="http://inverge.com/about/#bio">Steve Gehlen</a> and his crew for inviting me to speak at the <a href="http://www.inverge.com/">Inverge Conference</a> held this week in Portland Oregon. Great content, great discussions. Was particularly impressed with Weiden &amp; Kennedy Digital Strategies Director  <a href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3ib87d532315787d5a56f6648aa53163d2">Renny Gleeson's</a> presentation.  He has a good take on brand issues in this era of media convergence.

One snapshot observation from the conference however. We're still seeing way too many companies designate an individual as "digital strategist" or "social networking" director. Folks the web can no longer be described as emerging media. It has emerged. You are now officially living in a digital world. If everyone in your company isn't actively involved in digital strategy or if only one person understands social networks, you're in trouble.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Nothing Like a Little Chrome		</title>

				<![CDATA[Ok. Stop ruminating about the travails of the Republican VP candidate and pay attention to something that is truly revolutionary. Google launched a new browser today called Chrome. Calling Chrome a browser however is like calling the iPhone a telephone. Chrome represents a fundamental shift. A final statement that the center of gravity in computing is no longer the operating system but rather the web itself.

Adding sophisticated open source features like multitasking, advanced security and blazing speed, Chrome will make the web experience as well as web applications more competitive with desktop applications. Oh yea... and they don't charge for this either.

If you needed further evidence that the web has become the computational platform this is it. But this announcement also signals a paradigm shift that will kick the platform war between Google and Microsoft up to a whole new level. The launch of Chrome represents nothing less than an all out assault on Microsoft's fundamental business model. We haven't seen the stage set for a platform war of this magnitude since IBM and Microsoft went to war over the battle for the desktop OS nearly 20 years ago. The launch of Chrome will make the battle between Microsoft and Netscape look like a minor skirmish in comparison.

Stay tuned my friends. We are in for a fascinating ride. As an industry veteran, I can tell you that while this round is a clear hit for Google, do not count Microsoft out. As noted in previous posts, this battle will play out <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/5/3/floating-in-the-clouds.html">in the clouds</a>. So what's your take? Do you like Chrome, or is it just some pretty metal paint?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[If you've been monitoring the blogesphere lately you are aware that there is a hot debate going on about the future of PR. From Robert Scoble to my friend and former colleague Steve Rubel, the question everyone is asking is, "what's wrong with PR ? ".

There are some obvious forces at work that are causing turbulence for PR today. Clearly the Internet is the central discontinuity as it has been for media and so many other industries. The rise of the blogesphere, continued audience fragmentation and the redefinition of media brands in a search driven world are also causing a massive amount of disruption for the PR industry. There are a couple of related issues however that are creating even more havoc:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How Do You Define Success?<span style="font-weight: normal;"> PR value has historically been based on coverage, defined as literal column inches in print, amount of air time on television and radio and number of live speaking engagements, with increased value given to media outlets deemed to be top tier in their markets. The scarcity of media outlets drove this model. PR firms were ultimately judged by their ability to get coverage in a small number of top flight media brands. It was a model that was easy to track and monitor. You either got the coverage or you didn't. This was a "read only" model. The impact of the coverage was illusive to say the least. "Buzz" became an artful science and one fraught with misuse. The old adage of "there is no bad PR" became a cliche' for a reason. Good coverage or bad coverage was all relative. Other than obvious and extreme cases, the only really bad coverage was no coverage. Today with the Internet the center of gravity in media, scarcity has been replaced with ubiquity. Mass is being redefined. Buzz has become a tangible and one that can be tracked. Performance marketing is driving the vast majority of web based advertising today evolving marketing into what we call branded response. Performance-driven PR can't be far behind. Oh and there is one other issue...in a read/write media world they can talk back now. And when they talk back and you don't know how to answer them your PR announcement can become a PR crisis in a hurry.</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Context Is Everything. </span>The level of specificity and customization in media today is astounding. From the extraordinary functionality of Web 2.0 apps to the 500 cable channels covering every niche' market under the sun, todays audiences have the ability to find and engage with expert level content on virtually any subject and in most any format. In this environment context is everything.  Deep market, audience and domain knowledge are required today to be able to provide the level of context that the media outlets and in turn the audiences they serve have come to expect. Is this in and of itself new ? No. It is more important today than ever before however and more apparent when it's not understood.

Ok so here are a few thoughts for today's PR pros:
<ol>
	<li> <strong>Provide Metrics. </strong>PR is not immune from the outcome based nature of the Internet. Frankly this can work to your advantage. There is a new calculus emerging: amount of coverage x the value of the media outlet x the tangible response generated = success. This does not mean that PR doesn't have intangible value. It does. But rather than get caught up in the rationalization debate, define your value calculus and provide a concrete level of detail for clients.</li>
	<li> <strong>Know Your Markets. </strong>Perhaps its the impact of the transformation of media but I've never seen a more confused and disconnected time for PR in my 20 years in the industry. Frankly there is likely a parallel here in the feedback I got when I came back to then CMP Media, now TechWeb, nearly 2 years ago.  In my first few months I was inundated with feedback from marketers telling me that our average sales rep simply didn't understand the markets, their company or their products and in turn weren't offering enough value. As hard as it was to hear, the fact of the matter is they were right. After several years of living through the revolution in the media industry our reps had gotten so internally focused that they were out of touch with the markets we served. It took commitment and hard work but we dramatically improved our market-driven approach and our results reflect it. We keep working at it it too. Spend time in the market. Spend time with people who actually buy your clients products and services. Better yet spend time with people who could have bought your clients products but didn't. And listen. Learn about the ecosystem that connects with your clients products and services.  Don't be afraid to develop a point of view about the markets. Everyone is looking for context. If you have a well researched and thought out POV on the market and in turn how your client fits in, it will serve you well.</li>
	<li><span><strong>Know Your Media. </strong>Media today is multi-platform, micro to mega brand and increasingly integrated. It's a mind numbing challenge to stay on top of the state of well known media brands, let alone the massive number of new and or niche' outlets that are cropping up in all sorts of formats. The fact is however if you understand the markets your client is in and do your research you can determine what the leading brands are and how they fit into the market. Oh and just because a well known consumer brand has decided to launch a column in a B2B category doesn't mean they have discovered how to serve an under served market.  It just means you've been given a good sales pitch. Pay attention to demographics. In an era of SEO, Web traffic has little correlation to buying demographics. Most of the time it's the opposite. The fact that a blog or web site has a large number of unique visitors is irrelevant unless there is a direct correlation to their ability to buy your clients products in volume. Improve your MQ, your media IQ. Study the latest applications, media usage trends and habits. Balance your quantitative and qualitative understanding of what's going on with media and again here don't be afraid of developing a POV that you share with clients and the media. </span></li>
</ol>
Ok so now that I've likely angered most of my friends in the PR community, what's your take? Is something wrong with PR? Is PR in danger of being disintermediated?  Or are we just seeing the necessary evolution of PR in a Web based world?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Content is king. Again. Every time we forget this law of media physics it comes back to remind us. Sometimes the hard way. Need proof ? Take a look at the ratings for the ultimate reality programming the Olympic Games. Far exceeding even NBC's estimates, the Beijing Games coverage once again reminds us that if you provide great content, people will turn on their televisions. Need more proof?

How about movies? In a model many had written off as one in permanent decline, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5rutm5">movie attendance</a> is about to match if not exceed last summer's total, which set an all time record. We're also seeing an assault on the all time box office champ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/">Titanic</a>, by this summer's hit  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">Batman: The Dark Knight</a>.

Everyone laughed when Steve Jobs first described his vision for iTunes and his new device the iPod. No one is laughing today. Digital music sales this year are predicted to hit $1.8 Billion. CD sales in a death spiral? You bet. Don't mistake a format shift and lack of business model adaptation however for a shift in how content is valued. Anyone heard from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning">Sean Fanning</a> lately?

But wait just a second. In the Internet era aren't we seeing a steep decline in paid content as the model rapidly shifts to free content that is monetized via advertising? Here's a great trivia question, what's a larger market, global consumer spending on media or the global advertising spend? As my pals at <a href="http://www.pwc.com/">PWC</a> will tell you, the 2007 stats show the consumer spend on media at $930 Billion (growing at 5.6% CAGR) dwarfs the global ad spend of $473 Billion.  One more a bit closer to home. Last month in over 100 degree temps in Las Vegas 4,000+ people paid to attend our <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/">Black Hat Conference</a> representing a 15% + increase year on year. Oh yea and in case you haven't heard, the global economy is troubled.  Content my friends is still king.

Ahh but what has changed is the nature of content you say? User driven content, search driven content, vendor driven content, community content and the mash up of all of these represent the "new content". Without question we are seeing the fusion of media and technology fuel new uses and applications of content. We are seeing new media applications emerge that we never imagined and more being introduced every day. But content from multiple sources in flexible formats is not new.

The very first trade show (live media is inarguably the oldest form of media) I went to was some 20 years ago. I walked into the hall and saw literally every vendor I could imagine, easily accessible in a searchable, organized format that allowed me to find them by category, name or location. They even gave me this cool book that allowed me to learn more about them,  sort them and categorize them myself if I wanted (this was called search btw). I walked into an IBM booth and sat in on their presentation. As the spokesperson started the pitch (this was called vendor content btw) the guy next to me leaned over and said “this is all a bunch of BS…IBM doesn’t really offer this solution they just want us to think they do…” (this was called user content btw). I then walked into a conference track put together by the show producer and listened to a presentation by a renowned market expert (this was called editorial content btw). From there I went to get something to eat and while looking for a place to sit, joined a table with a group engaged in an animated conversation about a new technology that had been introduced that morning at the show (this was called community btw). Later that night I was invited to an invitation only party hosted by a content brand (this was called gated or premium content btw).

So is there anything new going on here? Absolutely. The Web has turbo charged the ability to find, personalize, customize, engage with and distribute content and has irrevocably revolutionized the media landscape. Web based technology has also added a level of contextual functionality that is mind blowing. Today if you aren't providing enhanced levels of context to your content by leveraging the tools available, your audience will create it themselves or find another provider who will. It used to be said that "content is king and distribution the power behind the throne". Distribution is a commodity in a web based world. It's ubiquitous. Today "content is king and context, the power behind the throne".

For media today success is about the integration of content assets; editorial content, vendor content and user generated content, in all formats, with the applications that will enable deeper levels of context. This ability has become a required core competency for the media brands and companies that look to dominate the next phase of media. A new model for media companies? Yes and one that is not easy by any measure. The source code today however is what it's always been. Quality content.

So what's your take? Content still king or is there a new and future king on the media horizon?]]>		</content:encoded>

				The iPhone Really is That Big of a Deal		</title>

				<![CDATA[Ok by now we've all been inundated with <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/iphone/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208808694">iPhone news</a>. Breathless reports about the new 3G iPhone, including videos and photos of people waiting in line to buy it are all over the media. Heck I've even seen multiple blog posts about the traffic that<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://mashable.com/2008/07/11/24-hours-iphone/"> iPhone blog posts</a> are getting.

Look under Job's leadership Apple has proven to be a uniquely gifted marketing company. Maybe one of the best we've ever seen. Certainly the best we've ever seen in technology. That being said there is more going on here than just marketing hype. The 3G confirms the iPhone as a major platform. The iPhone will ultimately have the same foundational impact that the Mac and the iPod have had on the consumer and the technology ecosystem. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_tech/iphone/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208808689">Perhaps it already has</a>.

1. <strong>Always, Anywhere, Everything</strong>. The iPhone represents the best example we've yet seen of fusing the power of computing and connectivity. Yes there have been more powerful systems. Yes there are examples of more open platforms. These issues miss the point however. It's about applied practicality and functionality. The iPhone is the first UI that seamlessly, elegantly and powerfully allows the user to move from digital apps to digital communication to voice in a system you can carry in a suit jacket pocket. The promise of mobile computing was to provide easy, flexible and consistent access to what you want, where and how you want it. This is a quantum leap.

2. <strong>Who, What, Where</strong>. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://twitter.com/mitchwagner">Twitter</a> (couldn't resist. one of our editors mitch wagner twittering about buying the new iphone!) and other apps have shown us the power of being able to quickly and easily share updates and communicate with our network of contacts. The new iPhone will now enable users to add in location based awareness and communication, which will be one of the next big apps.

3. <strong>Applications, Applications, Applications</strong>. All technology adoption and purchasing is application driven. The <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">application store</a> by Apple is a genius move. Similar to what they've done with music they've set themselves up to become the dominant platform for application development and distribution for consumer web apps.

Are we all giving in to the hype here? Is the iPhone just another "<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_phone">smart phone</a>" albeit one with cooler marketing? Having been involved with more market transitions and market hypes than I can count I think the iPhone represents a major paradigm shift and one that will have foundational implications. What do you think?

Quick shout out here for our next big event <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.liveevents.techweb.com/">Black Hat</a> the leading conference for security professionals. This unique and fast growing event has become a must attend for security professional and security marketer alike. Join us in las Vegas August 2-7.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Twitter Me This		</title>

				<![CDATA[I'll spare you the obligatory "who would have thought?" lead in here. If you're not already hip to the power of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> you will be soon.

Yes the really cool kids are already on to the new, new thing so my power user/early adopter friends and colleagues will note the trailing edge of many of the observations here. The <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/06/twitter_ceo_jac.html">next wave</a> in the adoption curve of Twitter users has hit however and as with all network apps, the value of the service is increasing as the size of the network does. We will soon see Twitter take a platform role in Media 2.0.

The combination of social networking and niche content distribution makes Twitter a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="https://twitter.com/informationweek">fascinating platform for media</a>. Especially in the personality driven, "have a take" blog era that is driving the majority of web traffic today. Bloggers like <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://twitter.com/scobleizer">Robert Scoble</a> are connecting with audiences and distributing their content via Twitter. Our own <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="https://explore.twitter.com/MitchWagner">Mitch Wagner</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://twitter.com/awolfe58">Alex Woolfe</a> have also found large and fast growing audience bases via Twitter. We are also seeing these bloggers seamlessly use the platform for both personal and professional commentary. We see Twitter, along with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=21717627024">Facebook</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=361909751">MySpace</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TechWebTV">YouTube</a> as key platforms for reaching, engaging and serving our business technology audiences. They are proving to be powerful internal communication and networking tools as well.

Twitter is more than a simple social networking or content distribution application. Like other emerging Web 2.0 platforms, Twitter is enabling a blending of personal and professional communication, journalism and interaction that is leveraging the power of networks. So twitter me this...As a media pro or observer how do you harness the social, business, network power of Twitter for your business?]]>		</content:encoded>

				LinkedIn or LinkedUp?		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2008/06/23/linkedin-or-linkedup/</link>

				<![CDATA[The recent post on <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/6/21/money-for-nothin-and-the-chicks-for-free.html">Bain Capital Ventures investment in Linkedin</a> at a valuation of $1Billion got some interesting comments <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/6/21/money-for-nothin-and-the-chicks-for-free.html#comments">both on</a> and off blog from media colleagues of mine.

The discussions have revolved more around the value of the LinkedIn user experience and service than the valuation of the company. If we agree that financial valuation is a trailing indicator of audience and user valuation, then this is a worthwhile area to explore.

There comes a time in early stage development of any business venture when you have to ask whether you are building a product or a company. In the era of Infoware you can substitute application for product. The clear issues to sort are about scale and in turn exit strategy. I can tell you from both the seat of the start up executive as well as having gotten close up views of this from literally thousands of start up companies as a media partner these are rarely simple or in some cases rational evaluations. What looks like a very narrow application to one person is the next Google to another.

From my vantage point LinkedIn will not scale as a stand alone business. They do not have the user content engine or developer network that Facebook has, nor do they have a content platform that gets regular, daily, workflow use. In other words they won't scale on their own and will need to acquire and or merge with another company to realize their ultimate value. Yes creating more of a platform strategy via a private labeling model also holds potential. In other words allow content and other related service providers to use the platform to create their own LinkedIn applications and groups for vertical markets. Bit of a tough business model though unless you drive substantial scale.

So what's your take? Will LinkedIn scale or will they get LinkedUp?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Money for Nothin and the Chicks for Free?		</title>

				<![CDATA[<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.linkedin.com/home?trk=hb_home">Linkedin</a> announced this week that they raised <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/social_network/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=208700345">$53 million from Bain Capital Ventures at a valuation of 1$Billion</a>. Let me state up front that raising money from major venture firms is never easy. Regardless of economic cycles or market transitions these firms don’t traditionally invest irrationally. In April of 2000, in the midst of raising a $25million dollar round for the internet start up <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/">Beliefnet</a>, I was literally presenting to the partnership team at Highland Capital Partners, while the <span class="caps">NASDAQ </span>melted down by nearly 400 points.

I’m proud to say that we got the round closed. Wasn’t anything easy about it however. Today we are in a credit crunch not a tech bubble so the dynamics are vastly different. This is <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/04/18/its-official-venture-investment-declined-in-q1/">no easy time</a> to raise venture investment though. So what does the valuation of Linkedin suggest?

Yes we are seeing <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">“social networks”</a> drive vast amounts of web traffic and Linkedin and Facebook are showing signs that they can serve as business networking destinations, which “suggests” multiple opportunities for monetization. That being said, none of these revenue opportunities have <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/news_corp_don_t_worry_about_revenue_myspace_is_doing_great">yet to be demonstrated</a> in any scalable fashion.

There are two paths here. First we are clearly in the midst of a platform war and one that is really in the very early stages. The publishing platforms for the web show signs of being able to harness both personal publishing as well as company publishing applications. Linkedin may hold significant potential in this area. As contextual marketing applications online accelerate these sites have potential to leverage advertising in myriad ways.

The other path here is career and jobs related. It could well be that Linkedin will ultimately be the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.monster.com/">Monster.com</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.dice.com/">Dice.com</a> killer. A viral network app that drives revenue through job listing and online recruiting services.

My take is that the only way Bain makes money on this investment is the jobs and career path. And they knew that going in. As Myspace and Facebook have demonstrated advertising-regardless of how clever or contextual-<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=0HEPOU23OPUGEQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=204701326&amp;_requestid=545353">is not a model</a> that is working on social networking sites and ultimately may not.  So what’s your take? Is Linkedin worth $1Billion? Or is this as the song goes “Money for Nothin…”?

Quick shout out here to the TechWeb Digital Library team. We soft launched V 2.0 of the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/whitepaper/;jsessionid=IBAG3GUQOM25SQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN"><span class="caps">TWDL</span></a> this week and it's beautiful.

				IQ, EQ, MQ		</title>

				<![CDATA[In the 1970's psychologists defined EQ or Emotional Intelligence, as the ability or capacity to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of one's self, and of others. Our EQ, or Emotional Quotient, is the measure of our Emotional Intelligence. The theory was that IQ and experience were not always accurate predictors of success in life or business but that EQ could be. Further study over next 3 decades have proven this theory to be correct. Studies suggest that EQ is twice as important as either intellect or experience as an attribute of successful business leaders.

I'm a big believer in IQ/EQ and have used the theories, testing and diagnostics that help to define these attributes in hiring and developing people and in my own professional development for well over a decade. I would add however that there is another level of intelligence that is critical in business. In media  let's define this as MQ; Media Quotient or Media Intelligence.

MQ is the ability or capacity to perceive, assess, and understand audiences and marketers media interests and habits in uniquely powerful and scalable ways. MQ is not about predicting the future of media. It's about knowing the future when you see it and being able to act on it.

In previous posts I've touched on the two revolutions in media in the last 100 years; television and the internet. While I can't speak to the television revolution I can to the internet revolution and without question the leaders that are driving this era of media have extraordinary MQ.

We tend to talk about very vertical skills in media from content to sales to audience development to finance. What we don't focus on enough is also hiring people with MQ, developing MQ in our people and creating environments that attract and retain high MQ talent. All easier said than done. So how about you? What's your MQ? What's your company's MQ? What are you doing to develop more MQ in your business?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Is Microsoft buying Yahoo? Can Yahoo survive without a sale that aligns them with a larger company? Is Microsoft in a death battle with Google for control of web traffic? Is this a fight for eyeballs or actually something else? What is the strategy for "Microhoo" if indeed a deal ultimately goes through? Not that arm wrestling with Ichan isn’t a blast but I’d suggest there is something far more at play here than simply increased traffic.

Google has touched off the era of application based media in earnest. Whether they will ultimately be able to expand beyond their singular powerful application of search as the primary driver of their business remains to be seen. For the near to medium term future it doesn’t matter. They don’t need to. Whether you define Google as a technology company or a media company is irrelevant. What you can’t argue is that they have changed the media business forever. What Google has enabled is true “infoware” the fusion of content, application and software. I can remember Bill Ziff talking about this eventuality back in the late 80’s early 90’s.

Infoware needs an operating system. Microsoft scales their business by defining and owning a standard so they can drive operating systems for everything from PC’s, to Macs, to smart phones to set top devices, home servers, automobile systems and beyond. Microsoft is looking to control the advertising operating system of the web and own the Infoware market. Oh and let’s not be naïve. If you don’t think Microsoft is going to take you into the Cloud you’re not following along. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/05/is_live_mesh_de.html;jsessionid=PKBCBQYYLJNRKQSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN?queryText=mesh">Mesh</a> may not be ready yet but for those that know Microsoft well this is par for the course. They will stick with this and take the fight into the clouds but it won’t be free.  So what’s your take? Is this really just a fight over who controls the most eyeballs online? Or is this the next battle in the Infoware wars?

Let me end on a brief personal note. I grew up in LA and have been a lifelong LA sports fan even while living in New York and San Francisco. If you were growing up in LA in the 80’you got caught up in one of the greatest rivalries in sports; The Lakers versus the hated Boston Celtics. So allow me to relive my youth here for a moment and strongly suggest that you catch some of the action in the upcoming NBA finals. These two legendary franchises are back and it should be a great battle. Go Lakers!!]]>		</content:encoded>

				Is This The &quot;R&quot; Train?		</title>

				<![CDATA[Are we in a recession? If so when did it start? How long will it last? What brought it on? Are all segments of the economy suffering? Why does technology seem to be uneffected?  If we are in a recession when will it go away? Is this like the 30's? The 70's? The 90's? Like 2001? Are we experiencing inflation? How can you have a recession and inflation at the same time? These are just a few of the questions I've heard in the last few months as I travel around the US and England.

Over these last few months I've also had the great fortune to hear presentations and insights from renowned market and investment analysts from most of the major firms. I've heard extraordinarily detailed presentations from famous economists. We even had the leader of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">Mashup Camp</a> and one of our content rock stars David Berlind post portions of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett">Warren Buffets</a> recent speech to share holders of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a> on one of our internal wiki's. One thing I can tell you is not one of these people predicted a recession or even a slow down as recently as 6 months ago. None of these experts are in agreement with each other on the details of the slow down either,other than that the credit and housing markets are at the center of things.

At the risk of forcing my 6th grade math teacher Mrs Arnes to roll over in her grave and some of my economics professors into heart palpitations, let me offer a few thoughts on the "R" word topic from the technology media perspective. If like me, you watched friends and colleagues sign up for low cost jumbo mortgages and put less than 20% down on seven figure houses over the last 5 years you knew this was going to end badly. So is it really a surprise to anyone that the bottom fell out of the housing market? No its not. When you consider the <span class="caps">EBITDA </span>to Debt calculus of private equity is it really a surprise that this model as well was ripe for an adjustment? No.

So why does technology appear to be doing better than other market segments during this economic slow down? There are several reasons:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Technology is the central nervous system</strong> for most every business and industry. In previous economic cycles the majority of technology was still focused in large companies in financial services, manufacturing and government. Today technology is pervasive in businesses of every type and size. Technology in business is no longer a nice to have it's a have to have.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>We are at the early stage of a new technology cycle</strong>. Web 2.0 applications, Mobile Computing, Virtualization, SaaS, Cloud Computing and other new technologies and applications are enabling business in ways only dreamed of just a few years ago. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.gartner.com/">Gartner</a> predicts that in the next 3 years over 70% of the Global 1,000 will totally revamp their data centers. IP based technology and the inexorable faster, smaller, cheaper technology paradigm is fueling a new cycle that is only just beginning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Technology levels the playing field</strong>. Technology innovation is the ultimate game changer. Small companies competing with larger companies, low barriers to entry, speed to market and rapid analysis are all fueled by technology. Today technology innovation is your differentiation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Customer is On Your Network</strong>. In previous economic cycles you could afford to hold off or cut back investment in technology as it was primarily an internal productivity tool. Not any more. Today business technology is about connecting with and serving customers. The customer is now on your network, be it a simple web site or a sophisticated e commerce site, customer expectations on being able to communicate with you and do business with you online have risen exponentially.</li>
</ul>
So are we in a recession? Technically speaking no, or at least not yet. Are we experiencing an economic slow down. You bet. Why is technology not as effected as other market segments? Because today business and technology are inextricably intertwined. How about you any market predictions? Are we about to board the "R"train or just experiencing some pot holes along the road?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Changing The Lead		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2008/05/25/changing-the-lead/</link>

				<![CDATA[Economists regularly produce reports that show the bias in demographic samples. For instance the latest statistics show the majority of wealth in the United States, over 71%, is controlled by less than 10% of the US population. The same sort of statistical bias is true in technology purchasing or in the purchase of any expensive, complex and highly differentiated product or service. There is an 80/20 rule where 80% of the purchasing is done by 20% of the customer set.

In technology it used to be simple to identify where this purchasing sweet spot was, as it was concentrated in large companies in technology dependent industry sectors like manufacturing, financial services and government. Today it’s far harder to locate volume buyers as they could be in any sized company and in any industry. Facebook ,as an example, a small to medium business by traditional metrics, is buying over 1,000 servers a month. YouTube is adding technology at a similar pace. The reality is technology has become a have to have for companies of all sizes and across all industry sectors, as our economy makes the shift from analog to digital.

So if volume buyers today aren’t so easy to spot, how do you find them? To a great extent they self indentify based on their information and technology consumption. Simply put, buying and managing technology in business requires up to date information and knowledge. So does this mean that anyone with an interest in technology is a volume buyer? Of course not. Oddly enough however we are living through a phase of marketing that would suggest this is true.

Demand generation has driven much of the growth of online advertising and marketing over the last several years. The efficiency of the web as a platform to drive engagement is astounding and operates like the ultimate direct marketing engine. The challenge is however not all interest suggests customer potential and the vast majority of companies today really aren’t tracking back to any sort of actual <span class="caps">ROI </span>or even evaluating media based on demographics.  As a case in point a product group at a major software company shared with us recently that they spent over $1 million dollars last year on a demand program with the largest lead gen platform in existence. When their enterprise sales org sifted through the thousands of leads that were generated they found 2 viable prospects.

A few months ago I was brought into a leading advertising agency who represent one of the major technology brands to talk about trends in the industry and online media. The agency took me through an elaborate presentation on the sophisticated online lead weighting system that they were using on behalf of their client. At the end of this truly complex system overview I noted that it appeared that their system valued a college student in a dorm room down the street at <span class="caps">NYU </span>and the <span class="caps">CIO </span>of a Fortune 1,000 company exactly the same in terms of sales lead value. There was a long pause, some glances around the room and the head of the group said “well I guess in some respects that’s true”.

The reality is the vast majority of online lead gen that we see today is the equivalent of standing on the street corner of a highly trafficked intersection, yelling at cars as they go by and valuing a car honking at you as a lead. To sell technology or any other valuable, complex, product or service you have to find the buyers who have the largest propensity to buy your product or service in the highest volume. It’s about volume buyers

It’s a safe assumption that the marketing world is going to drive a shift from the primary focus on <span class="caps">CPL </span>(cost of lead) to <span class="caps">QPL </span>(quality of lead). Marketing managers who are being judged simply by the number of leads they generate are going to either drive this shift or be driven. It’s inevitable as the level of sophistication about online as a medium evolves. What do you think? Time for a changing of the lead?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[What are the next numbers in the sequence 2,4,?,?. There are two answers here that are correct; 6, 8, as well as 8, 16. This is a test of thinking skills not math skills. If the path of this sequence is linear and progressed 100 steps the final entry would be 200. If the path progressed exponentially the final entry would be 1,267,650,600,228,229,400,000,000,000,000. We are now in the midst of the exponential media era. Exponential media brought on by digital media-fueled by the web-has created more change in the last 10 years than was brought on in the previous 50.

The linear media era, post-televison, was incredibly consistent with relatively easy and predictable changes that innovations created in media habits and media markets. Yes there were format changes in fixed media in audio and video and there were new choices in niche programming developed in television with the advent of cable but even these were easy to predict the outcome of.  Change in this era is truly exponential.

Think of the impact of 2 recent digital technology discontinuities; <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder"><span class="caps">DVR</span>’s</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media#Description">Social Media</a>. Nearly a decade after the introduction of the first <span class="caps">DVR </span>the television industry and the ecosystem of research and services companies that serve it have literally no answer for the technology. Friend or foe? Moneymaker or market destroyer? Have you seen the leading television research company <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nielsen.com/">Nielsen's</a> answers? There are sand burns on their faces from driving their heads so far down. If anything <span class="caps">DVR </span>technology has exposed the glaring flaw in television ratings methodology.

Concurrently social networking, along with search the single largest driver of traffic on the web in the last 7 years, is still a discontinuity looking for a business model. I would argue the only scalable examples of social networking businesses are actually the sites we normally think of as commerce sites; <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/homepage.html">Amazon</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://itunes-zo.info/itunes.php">iTunes</a>. So as we speed along this exponential path in media, what are the next numbers in your sequence?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[The next major battle will be fought in the clouds. Unless you've been living under a rock you're now aware of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/services/data/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207404265">cloud computing</a>. Cloud represents a major market transition. A new model for data centers, distributed computing and applications that will serve as the foundational infrastructure for Web 2.0. Virtually every business technology vendor is focused on this paradigm shift and staking their position in the cloud. There are a series of major battles shaping up between vendors ranging from <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_52/b4064048925836.htm">Google</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207401939">Microsoft</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/services/saas/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207200445">Salesforce.com</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://joyeur.com/2007/11/22/cloud-computing-infrastructure-for-facebook-developers-on-dell-servers-what-does-it-mean">Facebook</a> to <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/services/hosted_apps/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207500314"><span class="caps">IBM</span></a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.dell.com/cloudcomputing">Dell</a>. This battle is also creating some interesting new mashup partnerships. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/04/googles_answer_1.html;jsessionid=GXOXHDY53SVMAQSNDLPSKHSCJUNN2JVN?queryText=salesforce.com">Salesfoogle</a> anyone?

So what does this have to do with media you ask? Everything. Last week a leading systems and services vendor told me that Facebook is buying 1,000 servers a month. Google is <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/03/googles_iowa_da.html;jsessionid=GXOXHDY53SVMAQSNDLPSKHSCJUNN2JVN?queryText=google+">building new data centers</a> around the country as fast as possible.  If you don't view Facebook, Google and YouTube as media platforms you aren't paying attention.

Over the last few months at our company <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/">TechWeb</a> (formerly <span class="caps">CMP</span> Media) we've been developing and launching applications on Facebook, ranging from a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=13569836839">TechWeb company group</a>, communities and news feed groups around the brands <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://apps.facebook.com/iweeknewsupdate/?ref=ts">InformationWeek</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8696875837">bMighty</a>, through to groups for our major events like <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Interop/10388222006?ref=s">Interop</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Web-20-Expo-San-Francisco/6972960853?ref=s">Web 2.0 Expo</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5561504394">Enterprise 2.0</a>. We've also launched the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TechWebTV">TechWeb TV Channel</a> on Youtube. These applications are engaging thousands of new audience members, serving as dialogue groups to develop content and connecting our brands with new marketing customers. We've also launched applications on My Space and LinkedIn. These applications were created by our content and development teams and all of them reside "in the cloud". Our development efforts in these areas aren't unique for media companies either. Even the stodgy, market trailing <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.latimes.com/">LA Times </a>is recruiting for Facebook developers. So how about you? Are you developing a strategy to leverage the emerging power of cloud computing? Or do you think this is all just a bunch of people with their heads in the cloud?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Bit of a gap since my last post. Was inspired by our pal <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferris</a> so didn't post from vacation. Great trip to Hawaii. Fantastic time with family, good weather and got the chance to surf one of the legendary north shore spots <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.surfline.com/travel/surfmaps/surfspot.cfm?id=424">Velzyland</a>. Also had the chance to see <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy%2C_Jr.">Bobby Kennedy Jr</a> in action as he was staying at our hotel. Suffice to say he took an "interest" in my wife Linda...but that's for another post.

As many of my friends and colleagues can tell I spent part of my vacation studying the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/social_graph_concepts_and_issues.php">social graph</a>. As <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/about_alex.php">Alex Iskolds</a> piece illustrates <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> didn't invent the concept of the social graph but he may well have created the dominant platform in Facebook.

If anyone is still debating the social graph as a market transition for the web they are wasting their time

The social graph and search are driving the vast majority of consumer web traffic today. The real question is how to make money via the social graph. As usual this is a far tricker question that not even Facebook has answered.

The social graph revolves around community and the power to expand and segment your communities at the same time. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Kevin Bacon six degrees of separation</a> applied to your own personal and professional networks. Powerful, sticky, addictive applications that also leverage the power of content co-creation. In this environment however it's not clear how advertising works or whether it will be accepted. Contextual or social advertising models in community sites haven't been met with enthusiasm from users. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.facebook.com/business/?beacon">Beacon</a> has had a very <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=0HEPOU23OPUGEQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN?articleID=204701326&amp;_requestid=545353">rough introduction and it's future is anything but certain</a>.

This is not a consumer versus <span class="caps">B2B </span>issue either. <span class="caps">B2B </span>sites that leverage social networking have yet to demonstrate sustainable revenue models, although several are showing promise. So what's the answer? Is the social graph a powerful way of developing community, traffic and engagement still looking for a business model? Or is it simply a matter of time before this traffic is monetized the old fashioned way via traditional online advertising?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Hype, hope or hyperbole? Revolution, evolution or a simple change? A technology, a platform or a cultural movement? <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> has everyone talking. Last week we had a global leadership meeting for our parent company <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.unitedbusinessmedia.com/">United Business Media</a>, held in the heart of the Silicon Valley. We had presentations and sessions with business and technology leaders ranging from <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://tools.cisco.com/dlls/tln/page/executives/chambers">John Chambers <span class="caps">CEO </span>of Cisco</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://news.ebay.com/team.cfm">John Donahoe <span class="caps">CEO </span>of eBay</a> to the consultants and authors <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.newparadigm.com/">Don Tapscott</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.starfishandspider.com/">Rod Beckstrom</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.roycecarlton.com/speakers/mckee.html">Annie McKee</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferris</a>. The insights from these leaders and my colleagues from around the world, provided a powerful benchmark for where we are with Web 2.0.

For those of us who sit at the nexus between <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.contentinople.com/">technology and media</a> we've gotten used to the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://dondodge.typepad.com/">"next big thing"</a>. As John Chambers reminded our group last week, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">market transitions</a> create market opportunities. They also create market turbulence however.

True market transitions are revolutions. In any revolution new leaders will emerge and existing leaders will die. The conundrum is that for every real market transition we've also seen a ton of false starts. This has spawned the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=130115">hype cycle</a>. The connected reality is that in markets as vibrant, dynamic and valuable as technology and media inevitably false prophets emerge, predicting the future to their advantage. In the spirit of the Web 2.0 ethos let me be transparent here and acknowledge that we are the co-owners and producers of the leading conferences, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.web2expo.com/"> Web 2.0 Expo</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.web2expo.com/">Web 2.0 Summit</a>. Does this give us a unique viewpoint to speak to these issues? Or we part of the hype machine? I'd argue the former but I'll leave that for others to determine. Here's our take on Web 2.0 though.

Web 2.0 is the emergence of the web as the global computational platform. Tapscott in his book <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.wikinomics.com/">Wikinomics</a>, takes this thesis and provides a profound and inspiring look at the impact web 2.0 apps are having on economics, culture and business. Every market transition is led by the introduction or emergence of a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/youtubes_could_be_the_best_new.php">new platform</a>. These platforms provide a foundation, system and organizational structure to allow new technologies and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/5353.html">businesses</a> to scale. Think of these as languages or as currencies. Historically when a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab13">new language</a> or <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.moneyinstructor.com/doc/moneyevolution.asp">currency</a> emerged as a platform, cultures and societies expanded.

From a media perspective Web 2.0 is delivering on the disruption and new opportunities that were hinted at in the first wave of the internet. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting">Time shifting</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeshifting">place shifting</a> have totally and irrevocably disrupted the music, television and movie industries. This is only the beginning. We are witnessing the final shift from an analog to digital media industry. Web 2.0 now provides the platforms to accelerate this shift.

So, hype or hope? I'll admit at times I can get a bit over caffeinated about market transitions. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/">We essentially help technology pro's and the rest of the ecosystem </a>harness these transitions to business advantage. What hit me last week though was that from hard nosed business leaders like John Chambers to ex-Bain consultant turned electronic global market leader John Donahoe, to town criers like Don Tapscott, Rod Beckstrom and Annie McKee, Web 2.0 is far more than an over-hyped concept. It is changing everything. Really.

Quick unrelated note-silly rabbit segues are for kids-This month the 2008/2009 <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_one">Formula One</a> season launched with the first race in <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.grandprix.com.au/">Australia</a>. This weekend the race is in <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.malaysiangp.com.my/">Malaysia</a>. Even if you're not into racing or frankly even into spectator sports, you should check Formula One out. It is a technology, sport and globalization mashup the likes of which you've never seen.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Transforming CMP		</title>

				<![CDATA[By now most of my friends and media colleagues who read this blog have heard that we recently created 4 individual business units out of what was <span class="caps">CMP</span> Media.  The strategy of creating 4 autonomous businesses to accelerate growth and innovation is one I've been an active participant in developing and something I'm thrilled to be a part of, serving as <span class="caps">CEO </span>of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/;jsessionid=YPKRFZFS32PLSQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN">TechWeb</a>.

TechWeb, the global leader in business technology media, is an innovative business focused on serving the needs of technology decision-makers and marketers worldwide. TechWeb produces the most respected and consumed media brands in the business technology market. Today, more than 10 million business technology professionals actively engage with and rely on our global face-to-face events Interop, Web 2.0, Black Hat and VoiceCon; online resources such as the TechWeb Network, Light Reading, Intelligent Enterprise, InformationWeek.com, bMighty.com, and The Financial Technology Network; and the market leading, award-winning <em>InformationWeek</em>, <em>TechNet Magazine</em>, <em><span class="caps">MSDN</span> Magazine, Wall Street &amp; Technology</em> magazines. TechWeb also provides <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/services.jhtml;jsessionid=IDQRDIUVTM2I0QSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN">end-to-end services</a> ranging from next-generation performance marketing, custom media, research, and analyst services. TechWeb is a division of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.unitedbusinessmedia.com/ubm/aboutus/">United Business Media</a>, a global provider of news distribution and specialist information services with a market capitalization of more than $2.5 billion.

The 3 other businesses are <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.everythingchannel.com/index.php">Everything Channel</a>, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techinsights.com/">Tech Insights</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.think-services.com/">Think Services</a>.

Establishing individual businesses out of <span class="caps">CMP </span>was part of a multiyear strategy that has transformed our company. I’d humbly suggest our transformation is something that has changed business to business media and will be emulated. There was significant media coverage of our announcements but I think the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/globalbiz/content/mar2008/gb2008035_917372.htm">BusinessWeek </a>piece captured the strategy, the changes in media and our company the best. As I've mentioned before we will look back at this era and realize we were participating in one of the biggest revolutions in media in the last 100 years. It is truly a time of transformation and change. I was taught early in my career that in the media business you can either be the driver of the car, the passenger or road kill. Keep your hands on the wheel, your eyes open and drive on my friends.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Is Branding Dead?		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2008/03/15/is-branding-dead/</link>

				<![CDATA[Starting in 2003 we started to see the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3579096">growth in spending of below the line marketing </a>outpace above the line marketing. In basic terms think of below the line as direct marketing and above the line as branding and traditional advertising. Today direct marketing continues to grow while brand advertising is stagnant. There are many theories about why this is happening but most of them revolve around the impact and growth of the web.

<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> created a truly read/write web experience. This unleashed a whole series of  new direct, conversational and metric based marketing capabilities. No need for brand awareness and impact studies as click through rates, lead conversion and direct feedback from customers on the web let you know immediately how your marketing was doing. The one to one marketing dynamic that web based technology provided created an enormous shift to outcome based marketing. By another more basic name <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_generation">lead generation</a>. Nothing new about lead gen, but boy was the web providing powerful new avenues and applications to drive leads.

In the last few years this trend has driven some flavor of performance marketing to the forefront in virtually every marketing plan and shoved aside the “B” word. Branding has not only become less of a focus in some circles it’s became downright unpopular. So the question is in a web centric world is branding as we knew it dead? Has it become irrelevant? Or as one marketing VP said to me not long ago, “we’re not looking for brand awareness we’re looking for customers”. I’ve had several déjà vu all over again moments as marketers tell me about all of the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/;jsessionid=YPKRFZFS32PLSQSNDLPSKH0CJUNN2JVN">phenomenal leads we generate</a>, across all of our brands and platforms. They often pull out a spread sheet to show me the numbers and titles. The reality is though many marketers are managing to simple lead metrics not to conversion to revenue metrics. Nor are many really weighting any other factors other than an online engagement. In other words there isn’t any way to tell what other marketing factors may have driven the buyer to download information and register, becoming a lead.

Trends are always fascinating. Sometimes they thrill you; sometimes they make you want to crawl under your desk in a fetal position and sob. Well as my friends in venture capital like to say, “Make the trend your friend”. So where is this trend going? If what we are witnessing is a trend line we will see the continued and accelerating erosion of brand marketing in many business to business markets. On the other hand if what we are experiencing is a trend pendulum we may see a swing back to a more balanced approach.

My sense is that the Web has forever changed marketing and we’re not going back. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/01/business/01music.html?ei=5090&amp;en=ace9ad90dcea3d72&amp;ex=1301547600&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1144037165-ZFWLPuSxcaYNclFDw9qOQA">It’s like the music business</a>. The move from analog to digital has <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/e3ib928f7deb5877cac6ce289e7ccda3290?imw=Y">irrevocably changed music</a>. The same is true in marketing. Does this mean brand is dead? No. Not any more than saying music is dead. But how to brand has changed radically. Today most marketers are really driving towards branded accountability. Bill Herr of <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.unica.com/">Unica</a> calls this Branded Response. The same fundaments of brand personality, awareness, relationship still matter. I would argue they matter more than ever but that’s another blog post. How you market a brand today is more direct, more conversational and more transparent however. The web has become the center piece for this type of marketing. At the same time media resarch shows that the ultimate brand/awarness-preference-sale continuum is best driven by <a href="http://catsearch.atomz.com/search/?sp_a=sp10034b98&amp;sp_p=all&amp;sp-t=cat&amp;sp_f=ISO-8859-1&amp;sp_q=integrated+media">integrated media</a>. Buyers aren’t mono media in their information habits and never have been. There is a new center of gravity to be sure and it’s the web. That being said branded accountability today is driven by integrated marketing and the new web 2.0 tools and applications provide marketers with natural links for integration that provide powerful results. What are your thoughts? If you are a b2b marketer is it time to be thrilled or time to crawl underneath your desk and sob?]]>		</content:encoded>

				&quot;You Would Have Thought That Would Be True&quot;: Lessons Learned on the Front lines of Online Profitability		</title>

				<![CDATA[At two recent gatherings of senior  B2B media execs I was struck by how many of them told me privately that online wasn't yet really profitable. All had made "significant investments in online" and most had been making investments for the better part of a decade. These comments brought back a conversation I had at the dawning of the commercial web. In the mid 1990's my family and I lived in Manhasset New York. Great place to live. Very family oriented with some impressive business leaders, Wall Street masters of the universe, influential Doctors and Hospital administrators,  even a couple of professional athletes living there. Then there was me...The <span class="caps">B2B</span> Media guy. "Tell me about your work"  was not a request I got at the average party. That was of course until this thing called " The World Wide Web" hit. Suddenly I found myself at the center of cocktail party chatter.

At one such party one of my Wall Street pals made a beeline for me

saying “You must be thrilled about this whole internet thing. This will revolutionize your business. You will be able to bypass the post office, printers, paper suppliers, your <span class="caps">M&amp;D </span>costs are going to plunge and your profits will be obscene".  Well As a friend of mine Byron Elton, long time online sales exec who curently runs sales for <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.univision.com/portal.jhtml">Univision Online</a>, likes to say "you would have thought that would be true".  10 plus years later the internet is now finally (or should be in your company) a profitable growth platform. But the year of commercial profits online for many media companies became the decade of commercial profits online.

The reality is web technology and infrastructure has been more costly than people originally thought. Web development, ad operations, SEO, traffic and online audience development have turned out to be far trickier and more complex than the early days of web 1.0 led many to believe. And the lack of clear standards in web currency for the buying and selling of online media has slowed profitable scale for many web businesses. These conversations and memories  got me thinking about the lessons learned in the decade of web profitability. Trust me when I tell you these were lessons learned by experience not any unique vision. Like the birthing of all substantial markets it hasn't always been pretty either.

<strong>1.) Balance patience, impatience and tenacity </strong>. The brands and companies that have balanced these attributes  are now running profitable, growing online businesses. You can’t spend your way to (profitable) greatness nor can you save your way there. You cannot stay the course however. You must be willing to push into the future yet balance the risk. You must be willing to break glass and really change your model in the effort to build a truly scalable online media business.

<strong>2.)</strong> <strong><em>Make</em> it profitable </strong>. There comes a moment with most every businesses where you simply have to force profitability. You need to see if you really have a sustainable, scalable business or not. Yes there are some exceptions. They are just that however, exceptions. Don’t manage to the exception. Manage to your business and push it to profitability. Just make sure it’s the right time.

<strong>3.)</strong> <strong>Beware of Financial Optics </strong>. Online extensions of print or live event brands can be deceiving. Allocating costs can allow you to show a level of “profitability" that simply isn’t real. As someone who regularly looks at acquisitions I can tell you that the level financial engineering in this area is wide spread and sometimes shocking. Should you look at a brand level <span class="caps">P&amp;L</span>? You bet. However if the combination of brand revenue and profits doesn't outrun any decreases in any individual platform area (IE a decline in print) you are kidding yourself. Or you are playing financial optics.

<strong>4.)</strong> <strong>Your Content Managers Should Be Aware of Online Profitability </strong>. For some reason many media execs don’t treat content folks like business people...until it's too late. Don't get me on a rant about the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="/journal/2008/2/10/is-print-dead.html">daily newspaper business again</a>.  Many content leaders are only given cost budgets but not profitability targets. Share  profitability targets with your content leaders and better yet compensate them on online profitability. Just make sure that you pay attention to point # 3 as you do so. You will be pleasantly surprised in sharing online profitability with your content managers. If you aren’t you need to evaluate whether you have the right content leadership.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Have always found it fascinating when people use the expression, " This isn't personal. This is only business". Business is highly personal. It is a means of self expression and self discovery. This isn't to say that you don't have to balance the needs of "the business" with the needs of "the individual" and as a result make difficult decisions that affect people. To suggest however that business doesn't have a personal foundation is simply untrue. This is why the rapidly evolving nature of social software platforms and applications in business is so fascinating. Like the famous line about business not being personal, we are still struggling to define what we mean by "social" when we describe the use of these new platforms, applications and services in business. Is it the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social graph/micro messaging platforms applied to a business? Is it the private use of powerful wiki based platforms that can fuel increased communication and engagement amongst groups inside your company or organization?

We think that it's a combination of all the above. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29">"Mash Up"</a> if you will of Web 2.0 applications applied to business that allows for increased levels of collaboration. These tools are starting to create entirely new levels of interaction inside organizations. We're starting to see internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_sourcing">"Crowdsourcing</a>" as companies leverage these new tools to drive communication and information sharing. If we use the common term of <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enterprise">"Enterprise"</a> to define business, then the use of next generation web based platforms and applications to drive collaboration and crowdsourcing could be best described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_2.0">Enterprise 2.0</a>.

For those that are actively engaged in this fast growing part of the technology market you know that there is an active and open debate about terminology and market definition as the impact of these technologies applied to business plays out. So what's the big deal? Who cares other than a bunch of folks directly involved? Why are definitions important? Simply put common definitions and understanding scales markets. Every market transition is led by the introduction or emergence of a common definition that serves as a platform. These platforms provide a foundation, system and organizational structure to allow new technologies and businesses to scale. Think of these as languages or currencies. Historically when a new language or currency emerged as a platform, cultures and societies expanded.

Our sense is that while various applications naturally fit into subsets of this new market; be they "social business software" or other application based segments, the umbrella term of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enterprise_2.0&amp;redirect=no">Enterprise 2.0</a> is the market definition that best enables everyone in the ecosystem to understand this market in context. Full transparency here. Our <a href="http://www.e2conf.com/">Enterprise 2.0 Conference and Exhibition</a> is the leading event for the discussion, demonstration and evaluation of social software, wiki, and other web 2.0 platforms, tools and applications for business use. As our co-ownership of the brand <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/">Web 2.0 Conference and Exhibition</a> would indicate however we are well versed in helping to develop common definitions that scale markets and in providing the environments for the ecosystem to meet, learn, discuss, engage and conduct business.

So how about it? Is this social or is this only business? How do you define the use of social software, platforms and applications in business?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Regional Newspapers: Time To Burn The Boats		</title>

				<![CDATA[Content is king but distribution is the power behind the throne. Newspapers don't have a content problem. They have a massive and insurmountable distribution problem. Time to acknowledge this and accelerate the evolution from analog to digital. Magazines have a far longer print shelf life and will likely be the ones that really benefit from the new generation of digital readers; Kindle, iPhone, Sony, etc. It's difficult to watch once proud and powerful daily newspaper brands like The New York Times and The LA Times struggle as they cut costs in an attempt to right size their print businesses. At the same time this continued pruning is taking precious focus away from the inevitable future of regional news, which is online.

The shift from analog to digital in regional news isn't simply a platform shift. It is the moment of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Singularity</a>" for regional news. It is now impossible to discern the difference between the content and presentation from the underlying applications and technology in online media. The fusion is the experience today, as opposed to simply being additive. As radio gave way to the power of the video narrative of television, newspapers are now giving way to the visual and interactive power of the internet.

This is not to suggest that all newspapers are dead or that print itself has no future. Radio survived and adapted as did newspapers themselves during previous technical revolutions like television. The large, scalable positions for regional news however will be digital not print. The power of web based content platforms for reaching, informing, connecting, interacting with and engaging regional communities is extraordinary. It's time for regional newspapers to go all in. Burn the boats on the shore. You are now in the online media business.

				Advertising Doesn&#039;t Work On Social Networks		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2009/02/07/advertising-doesnt-work-on-social-networks/</link>

				<![CDATA[Advertising has been a non starter on social networks. The financial results of Facebook, Linkedin and even MySpace reflect the promise of social networks as advertising platforms may go unfulfilled. I'll go so far as to suggest that advertising simply doesn't work on social networks. How can this be? 100's of millions of people and it's not an ad play? No. Because social networks are not media. They're a service.

Google created a very unique business by integrating a world class search engine with a self service ad model that has scaled beyond belief. While arguments still rage over whether Google is a media or technology company; the fact that they derive the vast majority of their revenue from advertising causes most people to put them in the media category. I would actually put Google in the application, not media category. Google's level of utility and the elegance of the UI, is as powerful as any consumer software application every created. Google is the ultimate searchable database application. So isn't Facebook the same thing? No. Not even close.

Facebook is a software service. It provides an extraordinary user experience; with the ability to create content, connect with individuals and groups, share information and interact, follow and keep up with your social networks. Frankly it's closer to Salesforce.com than it is to an online media platform like Yahoo! or an application based utility like Google.

The potential of social networks as advertising platforms has to be evaluated against the backdrop of online advertising overall. To date, the vast majority of consumer advertising online is still following a television paradigm; interruption based messaging, limited if any context to the content being viewed and the hope that given the number of consumers reached, some sort of value is derived. To further complicate the issue, there is no common currency for consumer online advertising, as there is with television. No broadly accepted Nielsen ratings to base pricing on. In addition traditional ad agencies can't find a formula for reach and frequency online like they can for television and broad based print. As a result the vast majority of consumer online inventory goes unsold, or is sold at low CPM's by ad networks or by Google. The ads that do currently run on social networks are even more irrelevant, obtrusive and out of touch than the ads that run on general consumer online sites. The goal of trying to create contextual advertising for social networks based on the data, behavior and information of the users and their networks, takes a level of technical sophistication that is still years away. Not to mention the challenge posed by increasing levels of concern about the use of personal data collected by social nets.

So where does this leave social networks like Facebook? From my perspective in a perfect position. As a service based platform I predict you will see Facebook start to offer a series of logical, user driven services and applications that will best serve their networks. App stores like the iPhone store, services like Skype, eBay like commerce areas and Amazon like commerce applications and experiences. At a functional level, iTunes, Amazon and eBay are actually social networks. Facebook and other social nets have far more in common with these "commerce" sites than with online media sites.

So in the end is this advertising after all? I see it more as community based markets, where networks of friends and colleagues can connect with each other, information and services and will be willing to pay for increasing levels of functionality to do so. Not a platform based on users clicking on ads that marketers hope they find clever or interesting.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Creative Destruction		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2009/01/25/creative-destruction/</link>

				<![CDATA["Creative Destruction" is the term Austrian economist <a href="http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/liu/english25/materials/schumpeter.html">Joseph Schumpeter</a> coined to define the business Darwinism that drives capitalism. The basic theory being that new ideas, technologies, ways of working, organizational approaches and other creative discontinuities spark competition ultimately driving the economy. Through economic cycles of all sorts, across every industry and size of company, creative destruction has played a seminal role in driving growth, productivity and ultimately the economy itself. When the innovations, new ideas and new approaches in an industry become out of balance however, the natural process of creative destruction ceases to work. This imbalance is playing out in the media industry today.

Over the last decade we have seen an unprecedented level of debt fueled M&amp;A activity in media. In the last 10 years we've witnessed the largest roll up of media assets in history by public companies scooping up brands and companies to create media conglomerates that had "scale" and "synergy". Private equity increased it's activity in media deals over this time frame as well, completing the highest number of deals for the most value, that the market has ever seen.

The innovation in debt instruments that created the massive amount of capital to fuel this M&amp;A activity, masked the need for far more systemic and foundational change required in many media businesses  as the industry continued the inexorable shift from analog to digital. This debt fueled infusion actually restricted creative destruction as brands, companies and business models that were in dire need of wholesale change, were rolled up into broad conglomerates which were able to cut costs and show short term growth on the bottom line.

This process also held back the growth of innovative brands and companies that were practicing creative destruction in their markets, by thining the revenues, talent pools and resources that would have allowed for faster growth. This is becoming very clear today as a closer examination of many of the media conglomerates show severely challenged balance sheets. To put it distinctly, debt load is not a sustainable business model. It is a short term financing tactic; that requres significant market growth in equity value to work.

So where do we go from here? Well it's a safe assumption that many of the M&amp;A deals done at the height of the market will unwind as there is little if any chance that the firms involved can get anywhere near the value they paid, let alone service the debt load. It's also safe to assume we will see some assets on the market at what would have previously been thought of as unheard of price discounts. It would not be a huge surprise to also see additional bankruptcies as we've seen with<a href="http://www.ziffdavis.com/press/releases/080305.0.html"> Ziff-Davis</a> and <a href="http://www.tribune.com/pressroom/releases/2008/12082008.html">Tribune Corp</a> as over leveraged  organizations look to get out from under crushing debt loads.

The companies who have been prudent with their balance sheets will benefit. Those that haven't will suffer. I also hope that what we ultimately see come from this is a return to a more "natural" creative destruction where the innovation, new approaches, new technology and new competition come more from media businesses themselves and less from innovations in debt/equity financing.

<strong>Update on Friday, February 6, 2009 by Tony Uphoff:</strong>

Fair amount of on and off channel discussion about innovation in media based on the "Creative Destruction" post and thread. From my vantage point I don't share an overt cynicism about a lack of innovation in this era of media. The shift from analog to digital, the connected acceleration of integrated media and the emergence of social media and micro messaging platforms are all amazing transitions fueled by innovation. Not all of this is pretty or smooth however. It's also clear that while very challenging and in some cases stark in the reality it brings, the current economic climate is a positive forcing function that is continuing to drive innovation and change in the media business. Media always has been and always will be a business driven by innovators. As often times happens, financial speculators rush into a gold rush post innovation and that in turn creates a winnowing period as it sorts out. I would argue we are in one of those phases right now. This also creates tremendous opportunity however as you will see companies with solid business models but flawed capital structures that will become available in the market.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Enterprise Social Networking is an Oxymoron		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2009/01/17/enterprise-social-networking-is-an-oxymoron/</link>

				<![CDATA[Enterprise social networking sounds like one of those ghastly team building initiatives that otherwise well intentioned companies launch to facilitate employees getting to know each other. Posters with cute slogans, a series of awkward events with people standing around and someone leading the groups through an "ice breaker" exercise or two. The early stages of the corporate use of social networking software looks a bit awkward as well.

Terminology, definition, business use versus social use and ROI are all being actively debated as the category comes together. And the sure sign that this will be a hot category; Gartner is already predicting consolidation. Wait a second. Don't you actually have to have a market before it consolidates? They are also providing a series of confusing stats on the "potential adoption of enterprise social software" ranging from a low of 30% to a high of 60%. Ok let's not nitpick. Gartner analysts don't always tie their predictions to facts so let's not get complicated. Social software is poised to become one of the foundational platforms for collaboration and communication in business and will become a strong growth category in business technology over the next 5 years. You want stats? look at the adoption of Facebook in your company and how often it's being used for collaboration and communication in your business.

The business category needs definition though. "Enterprise Social Networking Software" is an oxymoron. Yes business networks have social threads running through them that share attributes with social networks. There are some obvious and distinct differences however, most of which would fall into the common sense category.

We like "Social Business Software" as the term that best describes the category. We see SBS as fundamentally a cloud based mashup of blog, RSS, Wiki and other collaborative applications and technologies. When used as a foundational platform in business, SBS holds huge promise for corporate productivity and communication. The social networking components and applications allow for stronger, richer business communication, expanding exponentially the one dimensional nature of corporate email systems.

Many people accurately predicted that the browser would overtake PC operating systems as the key user interface on personal computers. Social business software has the potential to do the same thing in business computing. Think about it. Do you spend more time on "social networks" that organize and filter your personal networks and communication, or more time generally surfing the web? Social business software will enable the same, customization, personalization, filtering and interactive communication in the business environment that Facebook does for personal networks. With added functionality, capability and security. Oh yea...and a business model.

Gartner is right in one sense. The current economic conditions aren't making it easy for start ups and companies like Jive, Yammer, NewsGator, Awareness, MindTouch and Socialtext, are all jockeying for position in this emerging category. You also have major players like Microsoft, IBM and others staking their claims and this will likely drive some level of early acquisition activity, in what is clearly a buyers market.

Social business software represents a new paradigm for business computing however and one that may well benefit from a tough economy. This market transition will create new companies, brands and applications and we will be watching the category carefully.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<p>In 1998 if I was to tell you that over the next decade&nbsp;broadcast television would sustain double digit audience declines, eroding away nearly half of the total audience delivered at its peak, and yet television&nbsp;advertising would increase in value would you believe it? In the same year if I was to tell you that over the next 10 years, newspapers would take their brands onto the Internet, nearly quadrupling their reach and doubling the number of ads they carry and at the same time&nbsp;lose massive amounts of revenue and over half of their overall value, would you have believed me?&nbsp;Doubtful. These things did happen however.&nbsp;Don't feel bad. I&nbsp;didn't predict them either. Nor did anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Internet and digital technology have ushered in unprecedented change in media. On that we can all agree. Exactly why however isn't as clear. I mean wait a second, in what sort of a twisted media world does it make sense that a brand more than&nbsp;doubles its&nbsp;audience and makes significantly less money and at the same time a brand loses half of it's audience and makes more money?</p>
<p>The Internet has exposed the flaw of reach as a media metric and the entire media industry is still wrestling with the fallout. For over 100 years, reach has served as the core currency for the buying and selling of media. How many people do you reach and what is your cost per thousand? Yes demographics plays a role. Premium brands with premium&nbsp;audiences&nbsp;are able to charge premium prices. This is mostly the domain of B2B and niche media however. In the consumer media world the basic calculus is still based on reach.</p>
<p>The idea that basic reach was not the most effective way to&nbsp;value media was being challenged long before the commercialization of the Internet. One to One Marketing was popularized in the 80's. Smart marketers have long been trying to drive deeper levels of engagement that would fuse demographic targeting with contextual messaging in order to drive response and engagement. For the most part however this was more academic discussion than a shift in media buying practices. Ad agencies simply haven't been structured to make money on targeted media, that revolves around&nbsp;engagement,&nbsp;in nearly the way they&nbsp;have been&nbsp;for television and broad reach print.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 touched off the engagement era of media in earnest however, by delivering a whole new series of tools, applications and platforms that enable contextual relevancy and engagement. The media&nbsp;industry is still lagging behind though. Take as an example the platform of&nbsp;Facebook. Everyone talks breathlessly-myself included-about the 150 million registered and 120 million active users. The reality is however Facebook is&nbsp;made up of a large&nbsp;number of micro niche networks.&nbsp;A huge network on Facebook is in the low thousands. As a result&nbsp;it's difficult if not impossible to sell reach as a driving metric and Facebok suffers as a result.</p>

<p>&nbsp;How about Google you say? Well yes Google has built and scaled the most powerful media app since the introduction of television. The reality here as well&nbsp;is that Google&nbsp;is driven more by basic reach, even though it's priced&nbsp;as&nbsp;Cost Per Click, which <em><strong>feels</strong></em> like something different than simple reach. The sheer mass of users of Google assures that any highly differentiated, complex and expensive product or service will generate a ton of response and also a ton of waste however. From a marketing and media&nbsp;perspective&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the equivalent of standing on street corners and shouting your message at cars driving in the area&nbsp;and charging per horn honk. Why do you think Eric Schmidt is talking about the power of brands on the Internet?&nbsp;His "without brands the internet will become a cesspool of worthless information" talk has not gotten the reaction it should. He's not saying this to be controversial. He's saying it because he doesn't want to see Google lose it's core brand value and become a broad mass medium.</p>
<p>Ok smart guy so where do we go from here? My sense is that the Internet will continue to evolve media enabling more contextual content, which increases relevancy and engagement. We are also learning that the Internet is not a solo act as the increased&nbsp;metrics of integrated programs with Internet, Print, Live events and other media demonstrate.&nbsp;As an industry though, we&nbsp;still lag behind in being able to provide relevant metrics, beyond simple CPC or impressions-which are really Web 1.0 versions of reach metrics-that enable agencies and marketers to redefine reach and drive relevancy and engagement. Anyone heard anything even remotely innovative from the research and tracking services in this area lately? Hello Nielsen, are you there? The good news is you have more people, using more media than at any time in history. We need to redefine reach however to assure that we can develop the appropriate metrics that are more reflective of the media platforms and audience trends that are a part of todays media world.</p>

<p>In closing let me wish everyone a very happy, healthy and prosperous 2009. While&nbsp;this will in all&nbsp;likelyhood be&nbsp;a challenging&nbsp;year due to the economy, there continue to be new areas of innovation and creativity in media, that will make life interesting and represent tremendous opportunity.</p>


 <strong>Update on Saturday, March 21, 2009 by Tony Uphoff:</strong>



    
   

    <p>Some good discussion on the changing nature of reach in media. To the question on television increasing in value, this is a simple metric, albeit surprising. The value of time for true mass reach on television continues to go up. The most recent Super Bowl air time ran off for $100,000 per second. The highest CPM yet. This is not to say all television air time has increased in value. But the CPM's for the largest reach shows with solid demo's are at all time highs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also heard from several people who wanted to discuss the lack of relative value in online reach and inventory. This is indeed one of the conundrums of our time. There are a ton of theories but most revolve around the lack of a common currency like a Nielsen rating that would serve as an acceptable buy/sell foundation. Many people feel it's only &nbsp;matter of time before QuantCast or another company solves this issue. Frankly I'm not so sure. I think the analytic driven nature of the web itself will make a standard sample, projection based model to become accepted. Ironically media that has no ability for truly transparent analytics commands higher-far higher-CPM's than online media which does. In a conversation with the CEO of one of the major online measurement services he said until advertising agencies can buy online efficiently, the same way they buy print or television, online media will continue to struggle to sell the reach they have.</p>]]>		</content:encoded>

				Social Media Follow Up Discussion		</title>

				<![CDATA[The recent post <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/12/3/social-media-gets-down-to-business.html">"Social Media Gets Down To Business"</a>&nbsp;resulted in a ton of questions, feedback and commentary both&nbsp;on and off blog. Ironically most of&nbsp;the dialogue has taken place off blog. This may say something about how social media stimulates interaction that's not limited to online.&nbsp;On the other hand it&nbsp;may also suggest something&nbsp;about&nbsp;this blog!&nbsp;Either&nbsp;way I thought this discussion worth&nbsp;posting...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How do you suggest setting up the leadership and management of social media?</em></strong></p>

<p>Paul Chaney marketing director at <a href="http://www.bizzuka.com/">bizzuka.com</a>&nbsp;summarized the question posed by multiple people:</p>
<p>"<em>Tony, you've just laid out, in nascent form, a social media strategy any company, large or small, could deploy. I herald all your points. They are well-taken.</em></p>
<p><em>One question. Do you feel a company should create a budget line-item to staff a social media management position? Or, should the marketing/pr departments simply adopt the use of these tactics and carry the burden to implement them across the entirety of the organization?</em></p>
<p><em>Again, great points. I'm blogging and tweeting this post".</em></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Social media is a form of communication and as such should be a core competency of the communications and marketing department in any company. As for hiring a specific person to run social media, that's debatable. My personal philosophy is that hiring a single person to manage something that is experiential and participatory like social media is counter productive. My colleague Mitch Wagner had a great line about the emergence&nbsp;of the&nbsp;title "social networking director" in business; "Isn't that what Julie was in charge of on the love boat tv series?".</p>
<p>There <strong><em>are</em></strong> some technology, application, content and communication issues involved in social media that can be tricky. Having a lead person in marketing and PR that can drive the strategy certainly isn't a bad idea. Just don't call him or her "social networking director". Also make sure that in defining this role you aren't inadvertently suggesting to others that they don't need to actively embrace and leverage these tools. Reminds me of a boss I had several years ago who didn't read his own email....but I digress.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong><em>How do you manage the communication with customers via social media?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>This is one of the toughest issues. One thing we hear a lot in this web 2 world we live in; "uh oh. They're talking back to us. Now what do we do?". If you are getting questions, comments or requests directly from customers on your social media networks you have to respond. This is a communication and marketing issue. Having a clearly defined process to assure that specific questions, requests or issues are responded to quickly and then directed to the right person inside the company is key. As noted in the previous post, Dell has done a very good job of swarming the feedback they get via social media and responding appropriately. Would also suggest that having a series of web links to additional resources and information is also very helpful. We launched the site <a href="http://createyournextcustomer.com/">create your next customer</a>&nbsp;to provide tools, research and resources for technology marketers and we regularly provide links to the site in our social media communication with customers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>How do we assure that we won't damage our brand by getting involved in social media?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>You can't. Anymore than you can assure that you won't suffer brand damage when a prospect or customer call isn't returned, or someone has a less than satisfying experience with your company or one of your employees doesn't present themselves well at a customer event. Social media drives transparency and authenticity. There are some obvious and inherent risks in this. From my perspective however, these&nbsp;risks are&nbsp;<strong>far </strong>outweighed by the increased connection, engagement and communication that the applications enable. Common sense is the best guide here. Be authentic. Stick with your brand truth and don't over promise in your approach.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong><em>What advice would you give small companies?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Dive in. The vast majority of social media apps are intuitive to use and not that difficult to create and manage. In some respects you have it easier because your size allows you to be more agile and nimble. The advent of web based media is a great equalizer. Small companies can reach prospects and customers and engage with them as easily as large companies. Our site, <a href="http://www.bmighty.com/;jsessionid=QR4NQ1I3NQ5XKQSNDLPCKHSCJUNN2JVN">bMighty</a>; the technology site for growing companies, offers great, practical&nbsp;solutions for small to medium sized organizations on how to harness IT and the kind of social media applications we are talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>Do you use social media for</strong> <strong>internal communication?</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes. You will find very rapidly that you will be communicating better within your own company-regardless of size-than you did before by leveraging social media apps.&nbsp;At <a href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus">TechWeb</a>&nbsp;we communicate internally using IM, Twitter - and other micro messaging platforms - Facebook and internal wikis, more than we do the company email system. We&nbsp;are increasingly leveraging&nbsp;social media applications to engage with&nbsp;and grow the audience of&nbsp;13+ million business technology decision makers we serve. At the same time&nbsp;we are seeing these IT&nbsp;pro's&nbsp;accelerate&nbsp;their development of social media&nbsp;for both internal and external applications.</p>

<p><strong>Q: <em>How about the use of Blogs?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Would seem ironic if I suggested blogging wasn't a good idea huh? No need to confirm here what you already know; blogs have become a very powerful way to share content, communication and interaction on the web. At TechWeb we produce some 50+ blogs that serve our customers and are adding more all the time. We also encourage our folks outside of our content teams to blog, as a way to share ideas, insights and engage with their peers and colleagues. We have examples of sales reps who have started blogging about their markets, generated a following and we've put their blogs on content sites to provide additional insights. Blogging for a&nbsp;media company is not a reach though. A blog is the web 2 version of what&nbsp;a column used to be. Blogging should by now be natural for media&nbsp;companies. Outside of media however it's more complicated.</p>
<p>My friend and former colleague Joe Panettieri who writes a great blog&nbsp;@ <a href="http://ninelivesmediainc.wordpress.com/">Nine Lives Media</a>&nbsp;offered an 11 and 12 to my original&nbsp;top 10 list, including the suggestion, "don't blog". I'm going on the assumption that he wasn't referring to me of course :). Here are his thoughts:</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em></em></p>

<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>"Solid advice, Tony. Dell, Cisco and others are proving that Web 2.0 media can drive new business opportunities and customer/media education. But there are some lame efforts out there as well. Often, PR and marketing folks spend too much time polishing executive blogs, and the executive's personal voice gets lost or homogenized in the process.</em></p>
<p><em>Two key additional thoughts...</em></p>
<p><em>11. Don't reinvent the wheel: People don't have the time to join many outside networks, nor can they remember passwords, usernames, etc., for all those sites. Instead, launch mini-networks within existing social sites (FaceBook, LinkedIn) or quickly build a social network on an open, free platform (like Ning.com).</em></p>
<p><em>12. Don't Blog... : Many executives launch blogs that quickly die. The reason: They don't have the time or focus to update the blog at least three times per week. If you want to launch a blog, DON'T do it. Instead, keep a personal journal in MS Word or your preferred word processor. Do this for a month, and update the journal at least 3 times per week. At the end of the month, see if you still have the energy and focus to proceed with the blog. For 90% of readers, I bet the answer is "no."". </em></p>
<p>JP raises a good point with his "don't blog" statement. Blogging takes time. There is a reasonable frequency you need to achieve-and more importantly maintain-to serve your audience. If you establish an expectation with a group of customers or internal constituencies that you will blog with some level of frequency and you don't, it's worse than not having blogged to begin with. Again here though, I feel that the opportunity to connect with internal and external groups and engage is worth the effort. Now if I could only learn to write as well as my colleagues in content!]]>		</content:encoded>

				Social Media Gets Down To Business		</title>

				<![CDATA[<p>There are now hundreds of millions of people actively engaged on social networks, blogs and micro messaging services, literally dwarfing any other media in size or level of activity. And there are more joining everyday. Social media has truly come of age. A year ago, in a presentation on the topic of social networking in business, I noted that Facebook had reached the eye popping number of 40 million registered users while Linkedin had hit 8 million. This week, as a panelist on the same topic at the Town Hall LA series, I noted that Facebook now has over 100 million registered users and Linkedin has just gone over 32 million.</p>
<p>Yes social networks have yet to develop clear paths to profitability. Facebook is still obviously in the burn rate phase and while Linkedin claims they have been profitable for 2 years they are still raising capital to support the business. There are also significant data security and data portability issues that need to be sorted. To suggest that these are barriers that will hold social media back however is simply foolish. Social media has come of age and businesses of all sizes and types are realizing the potential of harnessing the power of these applications to reach, engage and communicate with customers, employees and key influencers. This is most acutely true in the media business. So if you're still sitting on the sidelines wondering what this whole social networking thing is about and how you and your business should participate; here are our top 10 tips.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social Networking for Business Top 10</strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Dive In. </span></strong><span>Join social networks and start using social media yourself. Get your company and teams on relevant social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn as well as using micro messaging applications like Twitter. Create company, brand and product groups on social networks and social media applications. Create your own blog and learn about the process as well as the medium and how to leverage it. Do not delegate this to others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Beware of Social Media “Experts”.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Any time there is a market transition false prophets emerge, only too happy to share their expertise for a price.<span>&nbsp;</span>Build Your Own Capabilities. Yes this can be complicated but social media is by definition an experiential medium.<span>&nbsp;</span>Develop social media awareness and knowledge internally based on your own experiences. Social networking should become as natural as using email or basic web applications for your company. </span></p>

<p><span><span>3.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Don’t Chase Trends.</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Chase Engagement.</strong> Social networking is too important to put all your chips only in the Facebook or LinkedIn baskets. Don’t get caught up in the bandwagon du jour. Get your company and all of your people on and comfortable with social nets and applications. The key is to engage with your customers and prospects and learn the medium. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Focus on Your ROI.</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Social networking won't be a revenue driver or even have a tangible ROI for awhile. That being said the cost to create, develop and maintain these lightweight apps isn’t much. The need to have multifaceted (and multimedia) interactions with customers, prospects, employees and influencers is essential and social media will play a strong role. Focus on a series of metrics around engagement. How many people subscribe, join and or interact with your company and brands? And what are they saying? Engagement is the currency.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Be an early adopter.</span></strong><span> Start in a skunk works fashion. You want to build internal knowledge and a sense of what's out there, so that when (and if) social networks do offer serious revenue opportunities for your business, your team is savvy about them and doesn't come across like a 50-year-old at her first Gen Y hip-hop concert.</span></p>

<p><span><span>6.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>It’s Not Just for Big Companies. </span></strong><span>Social media is a great equalizer. Anyone can join and participate. It’s inexpensive to create, maintain and use. If you are part of a big company don’t let size get in your way of being nimble and agile. If you’re part of a small company don’t feel like cost or resources will be a barrier. They won’t be. </span></p>
<p><span><span>7.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Don’t Violate Your Brand Truth. </strong>Don’t dress grandma up in a miniskirt. Your company brand doesn’t need to suddenly become hip or change character to use social media. Better that it doesn’t. Social media drives transparency and authenticity. Stick with who you are and your brand truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Employees Are the Brand. Trust Them. </span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>We don’t set guidelines or rules for using social networks for our employees.<span>&nbsp;</span>We try to encourage the use of all social media including blogging and micro messaging platforms of all sorts. Yes occasionally we wince at something that gets posted. That being said our brands are extensions of our people and as such we want our people to connect with our markets and to leverage social media applications as one of the avenues to do so. </span></p>
<p><span><span>9.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><strong><span>Don’t Think Top Down. </span></strong><span>Social media is a grass roots phenomenon. Encourage the use from the bottom up, not the top down. </span></p>

<p><span><span>10.)</span></span><strong><span> Don’t Pitch. </span></strong><span>Be careful in using social media as a direct marketing platform. Yes you can and should tout your offerings but the concept of social networking is that it’s a permission based conversation. You are connecting with others who have common interests. It’s not cool to abuse a “social connection” to give a ham fisted sales pitch.</span></p>
<p><strong>Getting Started:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></span></span></span><span><em><strong>Companies should get active on Twitter</strong></em>. Talk about what they're doing. Go to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/">http://search.twitter.com/</a>&nbsp;input their company name and brands, and bookmark those searches and return to them to see what people are saying. If customers say something worth responding to, respond. If someone complains, contact them to try to fix their problem. That way, companies make friends and evangelists for life. You can't buy that kind of customer loyalty.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Create Facebook and LinkedIn groups for your company, your brands and your service</em></strong>s. Encourage your employees to join these social networks and actively engage with customers and prospects.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Who's Doing It Well:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Zappos.com.</strong>&nbsp;The successful online shoe company has YouTube videos on its home page. They have 200 employees on Twitter, with a link from the home page to all of their employee tweets. The text of the link is "What are Zappos employees doing right now?" The link goes to this page <a href="http://twitter.zappos.com/employee_tweets">http://twitter.zappos.com/employee_tweets</a> which aggregates all Zappos Twitters.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>D</strong><strong>ell. </strong>The company&nbsp;has made aggressive use of social media as part of an effort to turn the company around. They encourage employees to use Twitter. They have a team of people scouring blogs looking for mentions of the company -- especially complaints, and when they find something they swoop in and try to fix the problem. They have built their own social media platform for suggestions for fixing the company, used by Dell's thousands of internal employees. The overall strategy seems to be working; Dell's profits beat analyst expectations this past week.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span><strong>Fidelity Investments. </strong>They&nbsp;offer podcasts for investments guidance, and embeddable widgets to monitor the markets.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>JetBlue. </strong>Actively&nbsp;uses blogging, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, and its own social network to connect with its community.</li>
</ul>

				Twittering a Tragedy		</title>

				<![CDATA[The tragic acts of violence this week in Mumbai India were a sobering reminder of the shock and horror of global terrorism. My thoughts and prayers, as well as those of everyone at TechWeb, are with our colleagues at UBM in India and everyone who was affected by this senseless tragedy. The news on these horrific events also illuminated the growing pains that social media is going through as a means of getting accurate information during crisis coverage.

Immediately after the first attack <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/galleries/showImage.jhtml;jsessionid=IZALZH41OIGGMQSNDLPCKH0CJUNN2JVN?galleryID=99&amp;imageID=140&amp;articleID=202103424">people started posting news, updates and information</a> to Twitter and other social networks. These updates came from multiple spots in Mumbai as well as from afar as people offered their thoughts and prayers. As a reader it was difficult to tell the difference. For the most part the posts lacked context so trying to get a sense of the "who, what, where, when and why" was difficult if not impossible.  As my colleague Alex Wolfe noted in his blog post<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/11/twitter_in_cont.html"> "Twitter in Controversial Spotlight Amid Mumbai Attacks"</a> so much data was created but with limited insight or perspective. There were also some posts that appeared to be giving sensitive information about real time police activity in response to the attacks. The Mumbai authorities took the extraordinary measure of Tweeting, <a href="http://twitter.com/mumbaiupdates/status/1025820833">asking people to stop providing updates</a> on sensitive information.

There is no question that applications like Twitter have irrevocably changed the media landscape. Like all applications however the power of the technology can overwhelm the value if there is no discernment between data and information. There have already been stories criticizing the journalistic virtue of Twitter and other social media, used by the general public. My take is the social media coverage of the Mumbai attacks will serve as a tipping point in the debate on "responsible journalism" versus "personal journalism". The reality is traditional journalism has gone through similar growing pains as new technologies allowed for real time coverage, that in some cases turned out to be flawed in hind sight. Perhaps this is a coming of age moment for social media and our use of it as a means of accurate and responsible communication.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Where Is Your Social Network ?		</title>

				<![CDATA[I’ve been fascinated by the growth of social networking. From Facebook to Linkedin to Twitter, we’re seeing amazing levels of engagement. This engagement is remaking the media landscape too. I’ve struggled to embrace the term social networking though. Felt too restrictive in a business environment and too closely tied to the early pioneering brands like My Space to be taken seriously. Been giving this more thought however and feel perhaps I've been thinking about this the wrong way</p>

<p>Come at this as a question; “Where's your social network ?” and it forces you to think about it differently. It's a call to action in (re)defining your brand, your offering and your communications strategy to reach, engage and communicate with your customers.&nbsp; It's also a clarion call to redefine the way you think about integrated media. </p>

<p>The social network that a brand or company develops&nbsp;is nothing new.&nbsp; "Market", "ecosystem", "value chain" are all variations of the theme. In this context&nbsp;a social network is not just an online application however. It's the&nbsp;network of&nbsp; relationships of customers, prospects, suppliers, employees, media and influencers that drive your business. This network is&nbsp;by definition on&nbsp;and offline and encompasses every form of media. One of the natural&nbsp;outcomes of the&nbsp;business use of online social networking is that people meet, at events, conferences and&nbsp;trade shows, and share mutual interests that lead to doing business. This process&nbsp;is actually turbo charged by an integrated series of engagements, across multimedia.

<p>The level of engagement and dialogue that multimedia networks enable today truly do create "social networks".</p>


<p>So as you think about&nbsp;your branding, demand generation,&nbsp;connections, relationships and interactions with your customers prospects, employees&nbsp;and influencers, &nbsp;you should&nbsp;ask&nbsp; "where's our social network?". It will take you way beyond simple use of Facebook or LinkedIn. It will&nbsp;help you redefine the way you reach, engage with and build relationships with your customers by leveraging the integrated media platforms that bring together your social network.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<p>I've been trying to control myself but I just can't. Like Howard Beale in the movie Network, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!". Along with everyone else I've been following the dramatic turn of events in the global economy. The melt down of the credit markets has been startling and the continued fallout horrifying. I had thought however that the clueless "masters of the universe" attitude of many of the financial services executives in the face of the financial crisis was the worst I'd ever see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President club trips to resorts after the collapse and government bailouts? Debates&nbsp;over whether or not to forgo eight and nine figure annual bonuses in the wake of total financial ruin for shareholders? The lack of rational thought and public awareness of the management of these firms&nbsp;seemed the height of arrogance if not outright stupidity. This was of course until the auto company executives&nbsp;came calling on Washington.</p>
<p>The largest of the "Big 3" auto companies is General Motors. CEO Richard Wagoner, after an extensive career in finance with General Motors, took over as CEO in 2000. GM stock was trading at $60 a share at the time. <a href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/GM.aspx">Today GM stock is trading at a little over $3.00 per share and the total market cap of the company is $1.7 Billion</a>. Last year Mr Wagoner took home $14,415,914 in compensation, which represented an increase of 41% over 2006.</p>
<p>GM made the decision to double down on building large, inefficient SUV's over the last several years while Toyota focused on fuel efficient, hybrid technology cars and took over the lead as the largest auto company in the world. The results that followed were predictable. So GM, along with Ford and Chrysler, finding themselves in serious trouble decided to appeal to the US government for financial relief in the form of loans. Now here's where it gets interesting. Imagine you are working at GM and helping to prepare for these meetings. You are pulling financial data, health care costs, market trends and financial charts and graphs like crazy. You have all of the material ready, you've helped prep your boss for the grilling he's going to get on Capitol Hill and then as you board the company private plane to fly to Washington you think..."Hey wait a second. We're boarding the company private plane!!" Wouldn't you think at that point someone, anyone, would have leaned over to Wagoner and whispered into his ear, "Da plane boss? Da plane?". ]]>		</content:encoded>

				Fixing Microsoft&#039;s Media Business		</title>

				<![CDATA[Ok Steve, if your listening here's your play. Given the ambitious, sprawling company that is now Microsoft you find yourself fighting across a large number of tricky markets. You're wrestling with the IT giants, IBM, Oracle and SAP while at the same time battling video game console manufacturers in the consumer arena. Oh yea... and you're also engaged in a chess match for control of the online media universe with a little company called Google.

The folks in charge of your Microsoft media business keep giving<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN1534354920071116?pageNumber=1"> really cool speeches about their strategy</a> but as of yet there isn't a scalable media business emerging. The good news is you have ambition, determination, a strong talent pool and a nice little war chest of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=MSFT&amp;annual">$25 Billion in the bank</a>. And this year, even in a tough year, you will generate another $15 Billion in free cash flow. So here are a couple of suggestions on how you could put $20 Billion of your cash to work, instantly create a dominant media business and establish a foundation for your consumer position.

At it's current trading level of less than $12 per share <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/11/12/yahoo-almost-to-10-referee-please-call-this-fight/">Yahoo's market cap is under $14 Billion</a>. Facebook, while at one point valued at $15 Billion, is struggling to demonstrate that there is a clear advertising business to be built in social networks and as such their current valuation is far less than what it was at the peak. Let's make this easy math and suggest its now worth $6 Billion. <a href="http://valleywag.com/349206/microsoft-continues-to-lose-money-online">MSN, loses $1 Billion dollars a year</a>. Frankly this is hard to do. Even AOL is profitable, but I digress. In addition while there have been tons of people hired, good money spent and lot's of effort, the consumer branding at Microsoft is shall we say challenged. Microsoft Live indeed.

So how do you create a real media business as well as a brand construct you can park all of your consumer products and aspirations in? Buy Yahoo and Facebook. Roll them into a separate company with MSN that is a consumer facing and consumer branded company. Don't call it Microsoft. Call it Yahoo and have Facebook operate as a major brand inside this new company just like real multi brand media companies do. You will deliver a combined audience of over 200 million unique visitors, dominate traffic, social network engagement and now be able to better compete in search. You will then also have a model to merge MSN assets into so you can immediately go from losing money to making money online. From there you can turn your attention to helping Facebook define what advertising and revenue models work for social networking.

No thanks necessary. I'm hoping this will help clarify your media business and provide for the foundation of a real consumer position. I also hope this will help get you back to focussing on what really drives the revenues and profits at Microsoft, selling operating systems, development languages, tools and services to IT pro's around the world. Oh I have a few ideas on spending some of your money in this area as well but I'll leave that for another post.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The First Internet Presidency		</title>

				<![CDATA[Regardless of your politics one thing we can all agree on is that the Obama presidency represents the first Internet presidency. Comparisons to the use of television in the 1960 election have been made but miss the mark. Television is a broadcast medium. The internet is an engagement medium. The 2008 election demonstrated the power of the internet as a medium to engage large groups, while also allowing community leaders-defined by the online networks they are a part of-to play significant roles in shaping opinion, sharing their ideas and rallying votes. The impact of the Internet on this election was not exclusive to the youth vote either. The under 30 vote for Obama was impressive but negligible in the end representing the equivalent of a two state swing that did not have a determining impact on the election.

If we needed further proof that the Internet is the center of gravity <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/nov/07/barackobama-uselections2008">this election</a> was it. The stats are irrefutable. Take for instance web video. More people watched web clips of the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/11/07/in-obama-mccain-race-youtube-became-a-serious-battleground-for-presidential-politics.html">candidates</a> and the pundits online than they did in their original format on television; either broadcast or cable. The<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obama&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f"> comedy skits and riffs</a> from comedians ranging from David Letterman, to John Stewart to Tina Fey channeling Palin on SNL were passed around on the net at an astounding level. Added to the breakout of the Internet as the dominant platform for the recent Olympics, this election ushers in a whole new era for media and marketing.

We took an in depth look at the impact this election will have on technology and IT in our just released <a href="http://i.cmpnet.com/informationweekreports/doc/2008/special081107.pdf">Dawn of The Internet Presidency</a> from our InformationWeek Analytics &amp; Reports group. Every new administration influences how technology is viewed legislatively and symbolically. There will be an even more profound and lasting effect based on this election however.

The use of online applications like Facebook, Twitter, customized emails and other community development tools by the Obama campaign will forever change how elections are run. Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Facebook <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1640149255/bctid1904770014">spoke about this impact</a> at our Web 2.0 Summit earlier this week. The ripple effect of this will go well beyond presidential elections however. This is a clarion call for media, marketing and IT. Today web based technology and development are as core to media as camera, production and printing technology was to the previous generation. This election demonstrated the tremendous power that online media provides for user driven distribution and circulation for serious issues...not just funny youtube videos.

In the end is this really new? Perhaps for many of us who have been living at the center of web based media for the last decade this isn't a surprise. What is new however is that this election will be remembered as the tipping point that irrevocably drove the Internet to the center of gravity for mainstream media and marketing.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[At a dinner two weeks ago with CEO's and senior executives from B2B media companies the conversation naturally turned to the economy. There were varying opinions and reactions, some were optimistic, some pessimistic but overall I'd say the mood was pragmatic optimism. The discussion evolved into whether the tough economy was actually a benefit for some businesses as it might allow companies to increase share in a tight market. I volunteered that I thought this was one of the benefits of the current economic climate

Great media companies and great media brands take share in tough markets. They do so with audience's; by expanding share of total audience, time and engagement and also with marketer's by expanding share of marketing budget. I won't go into detail here but as <a href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/">TechWeb</a> competitors will attest, this philosophy is a core part of our cultural DNA, in bear markets as well as bull markets.

What surprised me was how some of the executives at the dinner agreed but only in context of "sales". They talked about not letting sales people use tough markets as an excuse. They talked about "sales" as though it's an isolated function in their company, practiced only by sales reps and disconnected from other parts of their operations. They made it clear that they didn't see sales as something that everyone practices. This is where we differ.

Growing up at Ziff-Davis under Bill Ziff's leadership, as well as CMP Media under the Leeds family, I received extraordinary media, business and leadership training and experience. One philosophy that was baked into my DNA early on was that "Everybody Sells Everyday".

This doesn't mean that content people cross the line and "sell" editorial. What it means is that regardless of your position you are selling a product and service to a customer. If it's content, then the quality, the packaging and the value will ultimately be determined by the level of audience engagement, your traffic, how many attendees you generate, how many subscribers you have, your readership levels and how the market responds to your content. Regardless of where you sit, Editor in Chief, to beat reporter, to blogger, to conference director, you are selling your value to your audience constantly. And you should be all too aware if you don't deliver high quality, actionable content that the audience wants and needs, someone else will. In today's digital world your audience is talking back to you constantly, providing a whole new ability to actively engage with your customers. You should be fine tuning your "selling" based on how audiences engage with your content in real time.

On the marketing side of our business, from the CEO of the company through to all of our managers, sales executives, sales assistants, to the receptionists in our offices, everyone works with customers. The value of our selling to our marketing customers is judged based on the creativity and the results of the marketing solutions we sell and our customer service. The report card on our selling in this part of the business is very clear as well. It's represented in our repeat business, our revenues, our profits and our share of marketing budget.

We don't view our customers as the employees of our company. Our customers are the professionals who rely on our brands, products and services to make informed decisions and the marketer's who buy our products and services to drive their revenues. These are the people that we sell to everyday. Everybody in our company serves customers, so everybody sells.

When people say, "they have good message discipline" or "they are all on message" or "they have a very focussed culture" they are touching on variations of the same theme. "Sales" is more than a business practice and discipline. It's a philosophy and one that entire companies should embrace. I know ours does.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Oprah, The Kindle &amp; InformationWeek		</title>

				<![CDATA[Oprah, The Kindle and <em>InformationWeek</em>. These are three brands that typically don't get mentioned in the same sentence very often. The fact that they are just might suggest that there really is something going on with the growth of The Kindle.

You may have heard this week that Oprah Winfrey endorsed the Kindle raving about the device as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co3j_yEnjpk">"life changing"</a> on her show. As UOM readers know I'm a huge Kindle fan myself having blogged my own endorsement of the game changing device with my post <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/uphoffonmediacom/2008/10/8/the-kindle-matters.html">"The Kindle Matters"</a>. I have a sneaking suspicion that Oprah's endorsement will drive a few more units of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Kindle</a> than my blog post on Uphoff On Media! What hit me about this however was the fact that my worlds are colliding over the Kindle.

My wife Linda is an Oprah fan. She records the Oprah show, reads her magazine and in general listens to Oprah's endorsements. As a rule however my wife is not a gadget fan like I am. An avid reader she took one look at the Kindle I purchased, smiled and went back to her book. After Oprah's endorsement? She is now going to buy her own Kindle.

Then our <em><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/;jsessionid=WISLM4EHH2GGUQSNDLOSKH0CJUNN2JVN">InformationWeek</a></em> covered the impact of <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/handheld/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211600532">Oprah's Kindle endorsemen</a>t. In the piece, Antone Gonsalves suggests that Oprah's endorsement signals that the Kindle and e-books are ready to move from niche to mainstream.

So what have we learned here? The kindle does matter and the mainstreaming of the device has huge implications for content producers and distributors. We've also learned that <em>InformationWeek </em>understands the digital world we all live in and the implications for business today. Lastly we've learned that Oprah has more influence on my wife than I do. Although I already knew that!]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Death of Simultaneity		</title>

				<![CDATA[Audience fragmentation has gone into hyper growth in the digital media age. The Internet was certainly the major innovation but we're now also seeing digital media devices like the iPod, Tivo, Kindle and smart phones enable time shifting and place shifting, driving even more fragmentation. You would think that this media fragmentation would be a bonanza for major media companies and ad agencies. More people, using more media, on more platforms creates even more opportunities to reach and influence consumers right? Well not exactly.

It's true that more people, use more media than ever before. The problem is that the media model the majority of consumer marketers and agencies use is woefully out of synch with today's fragmented media world. Simply put the marketing business model that many marketers, agencies and media companies use today doesn't work. And it's getting worse.

The two dominant advertising platforms over the last 100 years have been daily newspapers and television. There was good reason for this too. Both mediums aggregated large, diverse, mass audiences that provided marketers the broadest reach available. This sheer reach overruled concerns of demographic targeting as the efficiency from a cost point of view was unmatched. There was another reason these mediums were so powerful however. <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simultaneity">Simultaneity</a>. Not only did television and daily newspapers aggregate large audiences, they brought these audiences together AT THE SAME TIME. This created a double play. The largest available audience all seeing or reading your message simultaneously and in turn touching off instant word of mouth.

The Internet and digital technology enabling time and place shifting have forever changed the media world. They have driven the death of simultaneity in media.<a href="http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/01/primetime-network-tv-trends-1954-2008/5500"> Television ratings</a>, which peaked in the 1980's, have been declining for over 20 years. <a href="http://www.journalism.org/node/1296">Readership of daily newspapers</a> has also been steadily decreasing. Television shows that still drive some level of simultaneous viewership, especially those that are Tivo proof, like American Idol or live sports, command huge advertising premiums in a declining mass market.

The death of simultaneity does not mean the death of media. Again there are more people using more media than ever before. It does require a different marketing business model however. One reason that the Internet hasn't grown even faster as an advertising platform is the lack of simultaneity. Internet advertising is priced based on the number of monthly visitors, number of page views, or the number of clicks, registrants or some other metric of audience built over time. It's not priced by simultaneous audience. Internet media providers and advertising agencies have not created a standard currency for Internet media either. For the most part many agencies and media businesses are still stuck in a television or daily newspaper reach pricing model. Today marketing and media value is built by audience engagement built over time. It's one reason that lead generation drives so much of the online revenue today. I would argue that this is also why Yahoo hit the wall. In the land grab phase of the Internet when many marketers thought the medium was simply a television or newspaper model online, Yahoo did very well. Once the market shifted from a general reach paradigm to one of engagement built over time however, they were toast. And as their recent quarterly results, (64%) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/21/AR2008102101788.html?hpid=sec-tech">drop in profits</a> on flat revenue, would suggest, they are struggling to build the systems to play catch up to Google and MSN.

In the end, the ability that digital media platforms provide marketers to drive word of mouth and audience engagement will far surpass anything that mass, simultaneous viewership and readership ever provided. It's time for marketers, agencies and media companies to realize this however. And embrace it.]]>		</content:encoded>

				When the World Starts Running Down You Make the Best of What&#039;s Still Around		</title>

				<![CDATA[Always been partial to the wisdom of a good Sting lyric. Everywhere you turn these days there are troubling signs on the economy. To debate whether we are in a recession or not is ignoring the obvious. We are in the midst of a significant economic crisis that has reached global proportions. And it is going to take decisive action to get us out of this difficult phase. As I talk with people in my company, our customers, others in the media business and friends and family the themes of economic crisis are consistent but the reactions vary wildly. They span the gamut from solid pragmatic reactions to denial to fear, anxiety and panic.

Public figures that we assume have a deep understanding of the issues causing this mess aren't helping.<span> </span><span><span class="-a "><a href="http://www.thestreet.com/">Jim Cramer</a></span></span> of The Street.com, fundamentally a well informed shill for the equities market, is on television imploring people;  "whatever money you need over the next 5 years take it out of the market right now".  Economists of all shapes and sizes, commentators in every form of media, colleagues, family members and even "Joe The Plumber" are spouting off about the economy. The reality is that rising anxiety, fueled by non stop, conflicting commentary, government engagement and acute market upheavals, are creating a level of financial panic.

Princeton psychologist Hadley Cantril noted that social panics occur when large groups can't discern reliable sources of advice from unreliable ones. To this point it's a logical conclusion that the always on, white noise jumble of internet, television, radio, newspaper, magazine, social networks, family, colleagues and government leaders, all spouting gloom and doom about the economy, is actually making this panic worse.

So as a business leader in the media industry what should you be doing to lead and manage through a time like this? Here are a few thoughts:
<ul>
	<li> Seek Trusted, Tested Advice</li>
</ul>
All markets are driven by three main drivers; fear, greed and stupidity. It's easy when panic is in the air to prey on these emotions. At times of extraordinary change you also see the emergence of false prophets. "Experts" are everywhere and only too happy to add to your anxiety and offer their opinions and advice. Turn to people with expertise you trust and you know has been tested. In our company <a href="http://www.techweb.com/aboutus/">TechWeb</a> we are lucky in that many of our leaders have been battle tested in previous market cycles and know how to lead and manage through economic changes. We also have access to some extraordinary business minds at our parent company <a href="http://www.unitedbusinessmedia.com/ubm/aboutus/people/seniormanagement/">UBM</a> . David Levin our CEO has deep operating experience, having built and run multiple companies as well as strong financial skills honed by experience at Bain Consulting and in the venture industry. Our CFO Nigel Wilson holds a Phd in Economics from MIT and as well has had significant experience leading  businesses through challenging economic cycles. Starting early this year at our UBM leadership meetings, we begin having regular briefings on the economy, including bringing in economists from the major firms as well as media industry analysts to provide us with analysis and perspective on the economic climate. This is something we continue to do as well.
<ul>
	<li>Focus on What You Can Control</li>
</ul>
Panic creates the rather odd dynamic of driving people to obsess about things they can't control. In our business our focus is very clear:
<ol>
	<li>Build even stronger relationships with customers</li>
	<li>Watch costs carefully</li>
	<li>Execute, execute, execute</li>
	<li>Take share of marketing budget</li>
	<li>Work as a team</li>
</ol>
Take a deep breath. Focus your energy and time and do the same for those you work with. Panic doesn't scale. Focus does.
<ul>
	<li> Keep Perspective</li>
</ul>
Take the time to review history. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html?_r=3&amp;ref=opinion&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin">Warren Buffet's recent NY Times Op Ed</a> piece provides great perspective.  He notes that in the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497. He goes on to note that in waiting for the comfort of good news, investors are ignoring Wayne Gretsky's advice: "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been". There is also context and perspective to be gained in watching how other organizations are reacting to this economic phase. The venture fund Sequoia offered practical advice to their portfolio companies, encouraging them to take decisive action early in their now famous <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eldon/sequoia-capital-on-startups-and-the-economic-downturn-presentation/">silicon valley presentation</a>.
<ul>
	<li>Listen</li>
</ul>
Another component of stress and anxiety is that they can cause people to stop listening. Listen closely to your customers. Listen closely to your employees. Listen also to what your competitors and other parts of your ecosystem are saying and doing. You will likely learn something that is actionable.
<ul>
	<li>Be Visible</li>
</ul>
Leadership requires presence. Don't hide in your office, in meetings or on your computer. Keep your door open, meet with your teams and be accessible to all of your people. Remember that 80%+ of communication is non verbal. Don't assume that your communication or your understanding of others is accurate based on email and phone alone.
<ul>
	<li>Blow Off Stress</li>
</ul>
For me it's time with my family and friends, running, enjoying music, reading and on the weekends when I'm home, going surfing. At times like this I find that my running mileage tends to go up. Not necessarily a conscious process likely a natural reaction. btw on a related note, my apologies to the woman who was out getting her newspaper in Palo Alto earlier this week, who I scared the hell out of when I came running by at 5:00am!

So this is my perspective. I'd love to hear yours. How are you leading and managing through this challenging time? What advice would you give to others?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Blogging about media and technology feels trivial at a time when our global economy is in free fall and we Americans are preparing to select the next President of the United States in what seems like one of the most important elections in our lifetime. If I felt I had any unique insights or value to add on the economy to blog about I would. I understand media and technology however so it's here I will blog. Keep the faith. America is a remarkably resilient country and system. Now to the matter at hand...

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA">Kindle</a> matters. A lot. For those of us who live and work in technology, media and design hotbeds like The Silicon Valley, The Thirty Mile Zone of Hollywood or New York City we tend to think of innovation as something that happens like lightening. It comes on, as the patent office definition of invention goes, "as a flash of genius". The fact is however that most of the truly game changing inventions have taken many years to gain a foothold. Television took nearly 20 years after it's invention before it reached a level of critical mass. The Internet as well took nearly 20 years from it's inception to commercial impact. E-books my friends, yes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book">E-books</a> are about to have their turn. 20 years later E-Books are starting to gain traction and the Kindle is a major reason why.

Most of my family, friends and colleagues know I'm a major gadget geek. My wife regularly jokes that consumer electronic marketing departments likely have my photo on their wall. I was one of the first iPod, iPhone, Treo, and BlackBerry users. I've had all manner of cell phones as each new technological advance created a new set of features. Heck in the garage I've got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_128K">128K Macintosh Compute</a>r tucked away in a box. So it's not surprising that I've been into E-books.  After exhaustive investigation about a year ago I bought one of the more advanced readers from the original Phillips electronic paper team called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILiad">The Iliad</a>. Gorgeous device. Beautiful screen, fantastic features. Couple of problems though. They use a  proprietary, buggy software that forces you to log onto to a computer to access a relatively limited selection of content that's incredibly hard to download. Oh yea. And no wireless.

When Kindle launched people mocked the lack of <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/11/amazon-kindle-meet-amazons-e-book-reader/">elegant design</a>. "Looks like an etch a sketch". "Reminds me of an old TI Calculator". In the era of the iPod it looked decidedly low tech. What it had however was a great screen, simple, easy to use features and a fast wireless connection to a ton of good content. Well as you can imagine I'm now a Kindle owner and have to say it's a phenomenal product.  This isn't a product endorsement on my part here as much as a category endorsement. Is the Kindle the iPod of the E-book category? I'm not making that assertion. I can say however that I'm not alone in the growing interest in Kindle as the market is starting to gather real <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/14/amazon-may-sell-750-million-in-kindles-by-2010-thats-a-lot-of-kindles/">momentum</a>. E-books are about to have their turn in the spotlight and will now open up even more access to digital content from books to magazines to blogs to audio files. This has huge implications for content producers and distributors especially those making the move from analog to digital.  Perhaps the real question we should be asking is, what invention are you working on or have you seen that's been struggling to gain traction for nearly 20 years? Might be your next best investment.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[I had an amazing trip to China recently, visiting Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. Our parent company UBM now has over 100 employees in China and we have several of our TechWeb brands in the region, including InformationWeek China and are actively looking to expand our business in this fast growing country. Major thanks here to Margaret Wa our new TechWeb China country manager and also Dan Ye our UBM China development director. Both took incredible care of us, set up fantastic meetings and also allowed us to get an insiders perspective on this amazing country.

For those that haven't yet been let me suggest that you book a trip. It is mind blowing. The first thing that hits you is the sheer size and scale of the major cities. The level of expansion is also incredible. China is building the equivalent of a new New York City every year.

The mix of the old and new is striking. Innovative, state of the art buildings within view of the forbidden city in Beijing. Modern bridges, freeways and magnetic bullet trains, next to people riding in bicycle taxis in Shanghai. Given the population numbers, as you would imagine the major cities are very crowded. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing#Demographics">Beijing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a> are massive towns with nearly 30 million people in total between them. Getting around in these major cities by taxi is exciting to say the least but more orderly than you would imagine...even if you do have your eyes closed from time to time!

The Chinese people are very proud of their country and excited about the increased openness and visibility on the global stage. The still visible signs of the recent Olympic Games were everywhere . This is obviously a country that has a very different system of government than the United States but I was taken aback by how many Chinese people were eager that I understand "Chinese communism is very different than Russian communism".  The business climate is one of growth, increasingly open and one rich with opportunity. Given the government involvement there is significant complexity to doing business in China however. Ownership can be a tricky definition and media is a particularly complex business given the way media businesses are structured and monitored in China. As evidenced by the recent news of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7633467.stm">milk scare</a> China is also still wrestling with governmental oversight and disclosure issues.

Our customers in China are focused on the same opportunities and challenges as IT marketers everywhere; building demand, reaching all of the key decision makers, driving brand awareness and selling solutions. Print media is still flourishing in China and online is growing rapidly. Integrated marketing is just starting to take off in earnest and live media, particularly high level events, are very popular.

We met several small, fast growing media companies that I found fascinating. Won't name names here as some of them will likely end up as new businesses for us in the region. Suffice to say however that media start up activity in China is thriving. All in all an incredible trip. I look forward to my next visit and thanks again to our team in China as well as the new friends we made on our travels.

Brief side note here. It was an interesting experience to wake up my first morning in China, flip on the tv and watch wall street melt down. While I didn't understand the language the red lines on the charts were a universal language. One more...I'm not in the habit of giving advice on travel services on this blog but if you have the opportunity to fly China Eastern Airlines, pass. Imagine an airline run by the government. Heck after 10 hours I was a bit loopy anyway.  At least they got me home.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The New Era of Transparent Customer Service		</title>

				<![CDATA[Transparency is a commonly used term today. From government to business to the social graph, "transparency" has become a part of our every day lexicon. There are some obvious and high profile examples of transparency becoming a press relations nightmare; <a href="http://cdn.buzznet.com/media-cdn/jj1/headlines/2009/02/michael-phelps-smoking-pot.jpg">sorry Michael Phelps but I needed a good example here</a>. Phelps "bongisode" was a brand challenge. As a very visible, heroic figure, who's personal brand had been turned into a marketing platform, the image of Michael Phelps smoking pot clearly didn't have "brand truth" and the transparency of the Internet illuminated the conflicting imagery. In business this same type of transparency is shining a strong-and difficult to control-light on customer service. <a href="http://www.regis.com/about/">Regis McKenna wrote about the "Whole Product"</a> back in the late 1980's. His thesis was that the entire customer experience, including customer service, would form the whole product experience and that in a digital world this would become even more important. As has often been the case, Regis's vision for the impact that digital technology would have on brand as a result of providing transparency to the full customer experience, would prove to be accurate.

Customer review sites like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> have changed the way businesses engage with their customers. Unfortunately these sites also have potential for misuse. It's clear that competing businesses and disgruntled employees can leverage the "transparency" of these sites to mislead consumers, challenging the authenticity of Yelp's tagline "Real People. Real Reviews".  The lack of ability for sites like these to curate user generated content, creates a natural environment for abuse. Remember <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/google_schmidt_internet_cesspool_brands/">Eric Schmidt's commentary on the " The non branded web is a cesspool"?</a> As Schmidt noted in his now famous talk on the subject, "brands on the web cut through the cesspool". If customers begin to doubt the authenticity of customer reviews, then the reviews themselves become worthless. Worse yet, if consumers feel that the system is being gamed, it will result in brand damage. In the era of transparency this may be the ultimate irony.

Closer to home we recently came across an interesting example of transparent customer service. At UBM TechWeb we are customers of <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a>, one of the leading Wiki providers for business. In a recent internal meeting, I asked our IT and Wiki team to find a way to integrate our internal video programming with our Wiki platform. In essence, we were looking to add video serving capability to our Wiki so our employees could easily view our video updates and internal communication. To be clear, I never spoke to anyone at Jive about adding video support. My request was with our internal IT and Wiki team. A recent Google alert picked up a post to the <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/jivespace/thread/70229">customer service community on the Jive site</a>. In the post, a Jive employee starts the note "we just came out of a meeting where Tony Uphoff of TechWeb is looking to...". The post goes on to outline the request and ask for help in developing the solution.  From the conversation inside our company to the posting of this note was just a few business days.

Now if you are like me, you likely view this level of transparency as a double edged sword. Clearly companies like Jive are and will need to continue to use judgement on which customer requests and observations they post. How we use social business software platforms like Jive, is part of our strategy and as such should be viewed as proprietary. At the same time transparency in customer service when used appropriately, will speed solutions and create open source, community approaches that benefit both customer and product and service provider. Let me know what examples of transparent customer service you've seen and how you'd suggest companies manage this new era of customer service transparency.

<strong>Update on Friday, March 12, 2010 by Tony Uphoff:</strong>

Thanks to David Greenberg of Jive for clarifying and adding to the portion of the post talking about community oriented customer service. As his note demonstrates, in an open environment it can be tough to tell which part of the ecosystem initiated the discussion! To clarify however, he is confirming that Jive does not post customer input or requests to public forums unless customers are engaged as a part of the process. Thanks again David.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Laws of Marketing Physics Apply in Online Too		</title>

				<![CDATA[15 years after the web became a commercial platform, we are all still waiting for the Internet to become an advertising medium. Wait you say, the web is a huge advertising medium. Look at Google! Yes, the web has clearly generated a massive amount of marketing revenue. But its direct marketing revenue for the most part. Not advertising. The web has yet to fulfill it's promise as an advertising medium for multiple reasons.
<ul>
	<li>The power of Google and other search engines, created an era of search myopia that caused publishers to develop content, user experiences and business model strategies, focused on search optmization. Not actually on developing audiences and demographics. This became a death spiral for many, that actually drove the power even further into the hands of Google and other search companies.</li>
	<li>No common currency was developed that allowed online inventory to be bought as advertising or marketing. Television, print and other mass reach mediums have accepted currencies; Nielsen television ratings, audit statements and reader research, that create efficient markets for advertising buyer and seller to do business. The Internet has no such currency and as a result media companies struggle to define the value of their audiences and ad agencies have no efficient way to evaluate and buy online advertising. The result is the Internet has become a direct marketing platform. You could argue that having a search engine as the dominant destination on the web over the last 10 years is the equivalent of television guide listings being the dominant program on television. It doesn't make sense.</li>
	<li>The other issue that has held back online advertising is that the defining "laws of physics" in marketing : Reach &amp; Frequency are currently impossible to determine, track and evaluate for online. This exacerbates the problem for advertisers. How can you possibly do effective advertising if you can't really understand the reach to your core audience and then increase the frequency to drive awareness, retention, evaluation and action?</li>
</ul>
So where are the research companies? Why isn't Nielsen or ComScore or some other company going after this issue and creating the research tools, models and acceptable currency that will allow the effective buying and selling as well as reach and frequency planning for online advertising? Great question. To date they've made a lot of noise but done little in terms of advancing solutions to these issues. A <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/winning-online-is-about-serving-your-audience-not-impressions/">recent post from the head of Nielsen</a> however suggests there may be some emerging intelligence in this much needed area. Worthy of a read at the least. Look forward to hearing others thoughts on this.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Listen. Your Customers Are Trying to Tell You Something		</title>

				<![CDATA[<em>This is a post I did for our UBM TechWeb marketing site, <a href="http://createyournextcustomer.techweb.com/">Create Your Next Customer</a>. Been getting some interesting calls and emails from the post so thought I would post it to UOM as well.</em>

The irony of this era in marketing is that we have more tools, that connect us with our customers and prospects in more ways than ever, yielding more data than we’ve ever had, yet we still struggle to really understand them. The extraordinary power of digital media and the Internet has provided a host of new tools and platforms for reaching and engaging audiences and in turn generates a massive volume of data and metrics. I’m not sure however that we as marketers or business information and media providers are any better at understanding what our customers need based on all of this information. I’d actually argue that we are awash in so much data that it has made “listening” even harder.

The amazing power of Internet metrics is seductive. Finally, the ability to see how many people are actually going to a destination, where they came from, even when they arrived. We can see whether they clicked on an ad or offer and if so what actions they then took. We have richly detailed stats on unique visitors, page impressions, click-through rates and conversion rates to registration. As marketers we can really leverage this data. We can determine marketing ROI; cost per click, cost per lead, cost per acquisition. Like all data there can be tremendous learning from the analysis and certainly, very strong, actionable insights to be drawn from these metrics. At the same time this isn’t listening to an audience and actually as a singular focus for marketing, may be very misleading.

Take for instance something as basic as online click-through metrics. Using click-through rates in isolation as an evaluative tool to understand how marketing works for a particular audience is the equivalent of having someone stand on a street corner holding a sign with the company logo on it and counting the honks from passing cars as an evaluation of effective marketing. Billboards. Yes billboards have seen high single digit growth as a marketing medium for years. Are we to actually assume that if the audiences driving by didn’t viscerally react to the billboard, the marketing was ineffective? There is also the elephant in the living room for online metrics; the issue of demographics. The vast majority of the new metrics driving marketing revolve around online direct marketing dynamics. As a result demographics get lost, as they are particularly challenging to track online, most especially so in B2B markets. As an illustration about a year ago I was meeting with an advertising agency that represented a large, business technology client. They took me through an elaborate and detailed presentation on the extraordinary systems they had for lead tracking and analysis based on the online marketing they were doing on behalf of their client. After a 45 minute presentation I asked a simple question. “So in your system a college kid in a dorm room who responds and the CIO of a Fortune 1000 company who responds are counted the same. Right?”. There was a long, awkward silence, lots of looks around the table and the presenter basically said “well yea. I guess so”. Surprisingly I wasn’t asked back to the agency much after that meeting!

As technology marketers and technology business information and media producers we share a common customer, technology decision makers. At <a href="http://createyournextcustomer.techweb.com/">UBM TechWeb</a>, we serve over 14.5 million technology decision makers; encompassing IT professionals, Line of Business Managers, Service Providers and Carriers, Software and Web Developers, Government Decision Makers and Game Developers. The common denominator across these audiences is that they all are professionally involved in harnessing the power of technology. We do our best work when we focus myopically on the needs of these technology decision makers. We listen to them very carefully. We listen to understand what issues they are facing. Which products, services and vendors they are evaluating and why. What career and organizational changes they are thinking about. And how governmental regulations are affecting their work. We do this so we can better provide business intelligence and information that enables them to harness the power of technology and do their jobs better. And so we can better serve our marketing customers, based on our insights into our mutual customer.

We think it’s time to get back to listening. We think it’s time to add qualitative metrics into the analysis. Advisory boards, panels, discussion groups, meetings and qualitative research. We think it’s time to reintroduce demographic analysis into the marketing discussion. At the end of the day the extraordinary range of media metrics we have access to are simply trailing indicators of our marketing. To really improve our marketing effectiveness, we need to go upstream in the process and listen to our audiences to assure we understand their needs and can then articulate our offerings in ways that matter to them. We need to focus on true conversational marketing and like any successful conversation, you have to start by listening. We don’t see this as an old school versus new school issue either. Many of the social networking applications and tools provide an amazing foundation for listening and engaging with audiences. It’s all in how you use them and act on what you hear.

To this point, I'd like to hear from you. Please post your thoughts to this blog or email <a href="mailto:tuphoff@techweb.com">me</a> with your perspective on listening to your audiences and customers and share what approaches you are taking.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Party Like It&#039;s 1999. Make That 2009: 4 Lessons From the Media Decade		</title>

				<![CDATA[The end of 1999 was a wild time. It was the dawning of the 21st century. Equity markets were soaring. Media synergy fueled an unprecedented wave of mergers and acquisitions and the Web appeared to be sweeping everything up in its wake. The Internet was proving to be as powerful as the predictions too. Pure play online start ups were popping up everywhere and valuations surpassed larger, profitable, more established media businesses. The concept that the Internet would be more efficient than "traditional media" was a significant valuation driver. Another was the promise of multiple forms of revenue. The "3 C's": Content, Community and Commerce, served as the foundation for hundreds of online start up business plans. In 18 months, from the middle of 1998 through the end of 1999, I had two acquaintances of mine from the media industry make over $125 million in online media IPO transactions. 1999 was a party indeed. Like all parties however the rager that started the decade came to an end. And the next morning wasn't pretty. Nor as much fun. In some respects the hangover continues...

In the decade since 1999, over $200 Billion dollars in assets have been written down by the largest media companies. The value destruction in traditional media over this period of time is truly unprecedented. The number of private equity media deals that have unraveled in the last year, suggests that the value destruction isn't over either. So as we head into a new decade, what lessons can we learn from the last 10 years ?
<ul>
	<li><strong>The 3 C's Still Matter</strong>. Yes the industry has gotten off track with online business models that aren't sustainable and a search myopia that led to the temporary devaluation of content. The core premise that the value is in the content <strong><em>and</em></strong> the community that is created in and around the content <strong><em>and</em></strong> that this in turn can create commerce opportunities hasn't changed however. If anything the 3 C's are more relevant today than 10 years ago based on the new applications available to media producers.</li>
	<li><strong>Synergy is a Concept. </strong>Media synergy served as the main driver for the majority of the mergers and acquisitions over the last decade. As the value destruction we've witnessed since proves, most of the synergy was simply financial optics used to rationalize a deal. This is not to say that mergers and acquisitions don't work. Obviously they do. They are tricky however and require discipline and analysis that goes well beyond the financial modeling. If 1 + 1 is the only way that value is created, then the lack of scale of the core entities will result in a lack of synergy that will never be fixed. Your only option then is to keep acquiring until the sum appears to be more valuable than the crippled individual pieces. Does the old cliche' of "we lose money on every deal but hope to outrun it on volume" ring a bell?</li>
	<li><strong>Content is Still King. The Business Models Need to Change However. </strong>Seems like every decade we get into this debate about content or distribution as the king of the media throne. Clearly you can't have one without the other; as Comcast's $30 billion acquisition of NBC/Universal demonstrates. What is true today however, is that the traditional reach=revenue model that has fueled media for the last 100 years is under siege. Exactly how to best monetize content in today's digitally centric media world isn't completely clear. Quality content is expensive to produce and traditional advertising has fallen off as media fragmentation has accelerated. This has created a difficult challenge as media companies look to right-size businesses to match market conditions and at the same time, investigate new areas of revenue. New models are emerging however. We will also see the return of what were previously thought of as dead business models. Which leads us to...</li>
	<li><strong>The Internet is Not Free. Far From it. </strong>The Internet has made all content free. It's accelerated the decline of all media by providing free access to expensive, high quality content, causing producers to struggle to even regain their costs of production. The cautionary tale of the music industry is now playing out in all forms of media as the inexorable march from analog to digital continues, leaving paid content revenues in its wake. Right? No. The reality is that the Internet is far from free. Whether manifest as access fees, bandwidth fees or paid content in it's traditional forms, there is nothing free on the Internet. Frankly it's downright expensive. Sure the first wave of business models on the web have basically been built around the disinter mediation of print and direct mail focused on advertising and direct marketing revenues. This doesn't mean that there won't be a paid content market on the web however. I can well remember the first wave of cable television. The major networks laughed out loud. "Who would ever pay for television ? " they asked. They aren't laughing anymore as the blended model of paid content and advertising revenues of cable, brings broadcast networks to their knees.</li>
</ul>
As we close out 2009 with a party - ok so perhaps it's a little smaller than the 1999 version - media landscape is poised for a new phase that may well deliver on the promise we all felt in 1999. This time however, lets focus on real value creation.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<p>Ok so first let me geek out&nbsp;a bit. I'm writing this post at 35,000 feet above what I would guess is Kansas (don't they all look the same?) as I fly from Chicago to LA. While I hear endless commentary from other frequent travelers about how poor airline service is and the appalling aspect of charging for what were previously free services (tangent alert media industry...pay attention the concept of charging for previously free services is not your nightmare alone...far from it) the reality for me is I'm still geeking out on having wireless on flights across the country. It is a *huge* game changer and totally and completely negates the increasingly shitty experience of frequent travel. But, I digress. This is not the point of my post...<strong>Print. Yes print</strong>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can we possibly still have more to write about, kvetch about and discuss about the Rodney&nbsp;Dangerfield of&nbsp;media? Yes we do. Even in the most atrocious media market we have seen in many, many years, in the midst of the worst recession we have seen in 75 years and&nbsp;against the backdrop&nbsp;of the once every 100 year revolution the Internet represents, print will still be a larger revenue platform then digital media. Yea I know I struggle with this one too. But it's true.</p>
<p>So we have a simple choice as media pro's, we can either "burn the boats on the shore", decide that print is the equivalent of a dead man walking and get out now, or we can take a more nuanced approach&nbsp;(one might suggest stupid or brave...you be the judge) that while clearly out of favor print has a role and one that will sustain in some format. Let's examine this a bit.</p>

<p>Media history is littered with dramatic proclamations&nbsp;about new&nbsp;transformative platforms that never took root. It is also littered with dire predictions of the demise of legacy platforms that have yet to die. For&nbsp;God's sake, billboards-yes billboards-showed growth as&nbsp;a&nbsp;media&nbsp;category last year. Given that&nbsp;Billboards are&nbsp;largely&nbsp;unchanged from their origin&nbsp;as&nbsp;drawings on cave walls, is there an older and less high tech media platform? Was it just me or did I see Google spending real money recently on a Billboard&nbsp;marketing program?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been hearing about the death of print for the last 14 years. For most of these years I've been&nbsp;the one making the prediction. While it's true that&nbsp;in many markets (certainly&nbsp;in the&nbsp;B2B Tech markets we operate in) print is a&nbsp;far smaller revenue platform than it was at it's peak. The reality is it is still a profitable, viable platform however. The recent&nbsp;dramatic headline about Readers Digest filing chapter 11 you say? Did you happen to&nbsp;read past the&nbsp;lead graph that characterized this as yet another example of the demise of print media&nbsp;to the&nbsp;small sentence that noted&nbsp;the debt load of $2.6 billion that had been added on top of the business in the last two years due to a P/E backed sale? Perhaps that played a role in the bankruptcy filing? Yes. &nbsp;Less sexy story however? Yes again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;An interesting side note that&nbsp;applies&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;to the tech B2B market is the&nbsp;related trend of&nbsp;the&nbsp;NASDAQ. Sorry but I needed to&nbsp;shock&nbsp;you into reality here. That's right. The demise of print&nbsp;in tech media, when graphed follows a&nbsp;similar decline-minus the recent&nbsp;24% lift in the NASDAQ-as print does&nbsp;during the&nbsp;same time frame.&nbsp;But let's not get bogged down&nbsp;by data and facts...</p>

<p>There is no question that the advertiser has pulled back dramatically in their use of print. We continue to&nbsp;see screaming headlines about the decline of advertising in daily newspapers and magazines. This recession has&nbsp;accelerated the decline in print&nbsp; advertising as&nbsp;evidenced by&nbsp;the results in print&nbsp;from&nbsp;consumer to B2B markets year on year.</p>
<p>Ok so where do we go from here? &nbsp;Well I was hoping you weren't going to ask me that but given that you have I'll take a stab at it. Print overall&nbsp;will continue to be a declining platform&nbsp;for the next 2 -3 years&nbsp;at least. this decline will vary market on market and we will see some abnormalities that will defy the overall trend.&nbsp;The decline will&nbsp;primarily be due to the inexorable march from analog to digital&nbsp;and the resulting load balancing as the new digital center of gravity&nbsp;takes root. It will take time for&nbsp;marketer's to gauge the efficacy of print as a longer term part of their strategy. *Side note here...you cannot do medium or long term analysis of marketing trends&nbsp;based on a recessionary period...it is an outlier and should be treated as such. That being said there will be a&nbsp;long term systemic impact from the recession.&nbsp;What this&nbsp;systemic&nbsp;impact will be is unclear and frankly is the real value of the debate*. The other driver here is print innovation. Yes there is serious innovation going on in print and we will see this accelerate in the next 2-3 years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;rate of decline for&nbsp;print&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;if not impossible to predict.&nbsp;First off let's peg&nbsp;some&nbsp;relevant percentage of this years decline to the recession.&nbsp;In other words if&nbsp;general&nbsp; print media declines by 22%, which is the current&nbsp;forecast, the recession drove some portion of this.&nbsp;As the economy&nbsp;improves this too will change. It wasn't that long ago that my broker called me the day after Jim Cramer's famous melt&nbsp;down where he&nbsp;begged viewers to take any money they needed for the "next five years" out of the market immediately.&nbsp;With&nbsp;an earnest&nbsp;tone of&nbsp;voice my broker Matthew told me that while the market had been battered if I didn't get back into equities "I would miss the rebound market". I laughed out loud at the time and asked Matthew "what the&nbsp;genius's at Merrill Lynch thought the market was going to do in the next 6-9 months". He said that they felt the NASDAQ&nbsp;had the potential to grow some 20% based on the need for technology as the economy improved. As usual I didn't listen. Again I digress...</p>

<p>&nbsp;Bear in mind that the vast majority of&nbsp;hard&nbsp;data facts on the decline of print are far and away&nbsp;based on the decline of advertising. In other words, the decline in&nbsp;readership in print is nowhere&nbsp;near-regardless of the category-the decline in advertising. Pals of mine who work on wall street call this an "interesting arbitrage metric".&nbsp;Also take into consideration that before&nbsp;we became consciously aware of the recession-let's&nbsp;peg this as&nbsp;pre June of 2008-print&nbsp;had&nbsp;shown some signs of stabilizing after multi year dramatic declines.&nbsp;Similar to the data on "jobless claims" that&nbsp;reflect the loss of jobs year on year, the trend is slowing (let's hope that it continues!). In other words is there an augment to be made that print was on it's way to finding it's rightful, redefined spot on a digitally centric world and along came the recession and drove it down further ? Ahh. Are you a&nbsp;betting person? Then it's time to ante up.</p>
<p>The easy-if not smart money-says print is dead, long live the Internet. Frankly I've&nbsp;spent a significant portion of my career in this camp, while also carefully&nbsp;managing a&nbsp;smaller, yet dominant profitable print position as a part of my portfolio. So where do we place our bets today?&nbsp;Our company has market&nbsp;leading offerings in online, virtual environments, custom media, research, paid content, live media, integrated media and print. Yes I list print last as we certainly don't view it as the leading platform for our future. We do see print as a continued, profitable, valuable platform however. We think this for one really simple reason. Despite all of the advances of digital and live media, print retains a significant and lasting value with readers. Regardless of whether we think this is hip or not. At the end of the day I've learned one very simple truth that was pounded into me by one of my mentors in media the legendary Bill Ziff. " Tony, listen to the audience and focus on solving their needs and the rest will follow". He was right then and while he's no longer with us...he's right today.</p>

				The 9 New Rules of Media		</title>

				<![CDATA[<p>Over the last 12 months the state of the economy and the impact of the recession have been topics in virtually every meeting I've been in.&nbsp;The discussions&nbsp;have ranged from detailed analysis by "leading"&nbsp;economists (one in particular at a meeting in March&nbsp;was thrilled when at the end of his 60 slide deck now&nbsp;predicting a decade long&nbsp;slide in the economy, I asked if he had predicted the recession 6 months ago) to&nbsp;debates on&nbsp;financial trends, to&nbsp;simply sharing the anxiety the recession has caused for all of us. In general the common thread in&nbsp;each of these conversations has been the attempt to gain a sense of context. "This is just like 1987 or 1991, or perhaps 2001". "This isn't a tech bubble like 2001, this is a credit bubble".</p>
<p>So is this economic downturn like the others? Are there lessons to be&nbsp;learned? As an early management mentor of mine used to say "the only accurate predictor of future behavior is past behavior". So yes, there are comparisons to be made and lessons to be learned. Based on previous cycles it's safe to assume that the economy will continue to change, and these changes will outpace our ability to forecast them. It's safe to assume that we will see an economic rebound and it&nbsp;will happen with more speed than we expect&nbsp;and with unique twists that we won't&nbsp;anticipate. What else can we learn from the behavior of past economic downturns? New innovations will&nbsp;be&nbsp;launched, creating new opportunities and new challenges for existing businesses. In each downturn and recovery, innovations emerge and with&nbsp;them a new calculus, that changes the business rules. Nowhere is this more&nbsp;true than in the media business.</p>

<p>The center of gravity&nbsp;in media has been on a decade long transition from analog to digital. Traditional media companies have taken their lumps during this transformative phase.&nbsp;At the same time many&nbsp;pure play digital media businesses haven't yet demonstrated the scale some&nbsp;predicted. The recession&nbsp;has accelerated these trends but also shut off the main driver of growth over the last decade;readily available, cheap capital that&nbsp;enabled P/E backed&nbsp;M &amp; A. So we can safely predict that a series of&nbsp;new media&nbsp;rules will emerge out of this economy; driven by the perfect storm of the recession and the continued impact of technology. We can also safely predict that all of us will be challenged to rethink our businesses. So here's our take on&nbsp;the 9 new rules of media:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reach No Longer Equals Revenue</strong>. The new calculus is: Content Equals Engagement-Engagement Equals Revenue.</li>

<li><strong>The Moment of Singularity in Media Has Arrived</strong>. Content and the applications and technology with which it's viewed and interacted with have become inextricably intertwined. </li>
<li><strong>Below the Line Marketing Has Become Above the Line Marketing</strong>. The Traditional branding and advertising market has been devastated but not simply because of the recession. Branded response is replacing traditional branding.</li>
<li><strong>Content as a Marketing Platform</strong>. Advertising is being rapidly replaced by knowledge exchange based on content. </li>
<li><strong>Integrate, Integrate, Integrate</strong>. People naturally create their own information networks by integrating&nbsp;content from various sources. Make it easier for your audiences to integrate content or someone else will. </li>
<li><strong>Live Media is the Original Social Media</strong>. Ironically live media, conferences and trade shows, showed extraordinary growth at the same time social networks were launched and started their growth curve. Live media will continue to serve as a central part of the media ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Brands Matter</strong>. As Eric Schmidt CEO of Google has stated "the unbranded web is a cesspool". You will see a return to branded content as audiences and marketers drive a flight to quality and wake up from the hangover of the "User-Driven Content" era. </li>

<li><strong>Paid Content Will Thrive</strong>. Given the amount of money the average person pays to have web access there is an inherent irony to the proclamation that the web is making all content free. People always have and always will pay for quality content. The challenge that many media companies are wrestling with is that their traditional advertising supported business model has been blown apart. When cable was launched there were dire predictions that people would never pay for television that they had been getting for free since its inception. Taken a look at your cable or sattelite bill lately? We will likely see several new business models emerge but there will be a vibrant and growing paid content business.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge the Assumptions that Made You Rich</strong>. One of the hardest things to do is to change the core strategy that built your business. Even when you see&nbsp;it in decline. Company philosophy and culture should sustain. Strategy and business models should evolve and in some cases be blown apart. Redefining your business to adapt to today's market is tough. Far easier to simply cut costs and hope for an economic recovery. Saving your way to greatness isn't a business model however. This economy will recover but it won't come back as a clone of the economy before it. Use this&nbsp;time to truly rethink your business and challenge the core assumptions in your&nbsp;business models.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know for sure that innovation and change will come with the resurgent economy. What new rules do you see emerging? Any you'd add to this list?</p>]]>		</content:encoded>

				Michael Jackson: Best Dot Com Meeting Ever		</title>

				<![CDATA[Without question the best dot com meeting of all time was the meeting we had in 2000 with Michael Jackson-yes that Michael Jackson-introducing him to the venture investors in our Internet start up Beliefnet. Jackson was looking to raise money for a theme park venture on his Neverland Ranch. One of our columnists was the <a href="http://www.shmuley.com/">Rabbi Schmuley Boteach </a>who was a friend of Michael's and had facilitated Michael writing a column for Beliefnet. Schmuley called one day and asked if we, along with our venture investors, would meet with Jackson and his people to discuss potential investments in his theme park venture.

This request came at literally the peak of the dot com wave. Venture Capital was riding high and it was very difficult to get a meeting with major venture players. We were lucky in that we had 5 leading venture funds invested in Beliefnet. I will note however that I was getting on average 4-5 requests a day from people trying to get investments from these funds, asking me for an introduction. I wasn't sure what sort of response I was going to get when I sent off the email, asking if our investors were interested in taking a meeting with Michael Jackson. The responses were immediate; "you mean THE Michael Jackson? Where and when and if I can make it I will".

Truly surreal meeting, even for the surreal time. Our team of 5, along with 35 other venture or new media types in Jackson's suite at the Four Season's in New York City. My former colleague and one of the founders of Beliefnet the late Bob Nylen wrote about the meeting in his book <a href="http://www.randomhouse.ca/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781588368652">Guts</a>.

Michael's "business partners" were a fascinating blend of Hollywood hipsters and celebrity groupies. When he was finally introduced he got up and in that halting whisper of a voice that is so familiar to millions of fans around the world, started to describe his vision for a theme park on his property called Neverland. After about 5 minutes or so he got more comfortable, his voice stronger and he proceeded to give a robust overview of the theme park business, including development costs, ride capacity and throughput, character licensing and merchandising. At one point I glanced around the room and noticed that virtually everyone was staring in amazement. At the end of his brief presentation, his associates said that he had graciously offered to pose for pictures and sign autographs if anyone wanted to. Given the time and the "master of the universe" level of the people in the room I anticipated that most would politely decline. I was almost knocked over as everyone rushed to get a picture with the King of Pop. I was right there with them. He was incredibly gracious, signing an autograph for my then 9 year old daughter Olivia. When we posed for a picture together he shook my hand gazing up at my 6'5" frame,  leaned in and said "my you're a big fella aren't you"? Truly amazing.

Like many people I have mixed feelings about the legacy of Michael Jackson. No debate however. He immediately goes on the pop music Mount Rushmore along with Elvis and the Beatles. He was an innovator and a transcendent talent. I was not a big fan of pop music in the early 80's, sticking instead to rock and jazz. I can well remember the feeling however when I first heard the Michael Jackson song "Beat It" with the guitar breaks by Eddie Van Halen. It was the first time I had heard a mash up of genre's, blending pop and rock. Hadn't heard anything like it. Frankly haven't since either.

So as the world mourns the passing of a great artist, I will salute him as well by remembering his place in the best dot com meeting ever.]]>		</content:encoded>

				7 Key Themes on the State of Tech Marketing Today		</title>

				<![CDATA[This is an extraordinary time in technology marketing. The turbulent economy combined with the continued Internet media revolution has created an unprecedented time of change and transformation. In discussions over the last several months with our customers; business technology decision makers and technology marketers, several common themes have emerged that provide a sense of the state of technology marketing today. Last week in the bay area we gathered together 25 senior technology marketing executives to share their thoughts and experiences and it was clear that these themes resonated with them as well:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Above the Line and Below the Line Marketing are Coming Together</strong>. The lines between traditional advertising and marketing, considered "above the line" and direct marketing or "below the line" marketing have now blurred in B2B marketing.</li>
	<li><strong>The Emergence of Outcome Based Marketing</strong>. Tech marketing today begins with the end in mind. Advertising is the result of a focus on a desired outcome as opposed to the creative process driven budgeting of the previous era.</li>
	<li><strong>The Redefinition of Brand</strong>. The "B" word in technology marketing is going through the most dramatic transformation that I can remember since the days of the direct PC industry. Branded response is the watch word today.</li>
	<li><strong>The Rise of Application Based Media.</strong> From email newsletters to web casts, RSS feeds, social networks and twitter to virtual trade shows and virtual environments, application based media is driving unprecedented levels of audience engagement in technology marketing.</li>
	<li><strong>The Acceleration of Media Integration.</strong> Technology decision makers have the ability to customize and organize information into highly integrated media information systems today. Technology marketing by definition must be as integrated as the integrated media choices of technology decision makers.</li>
	<li><strong>The Shift from Advertising to Knowledge Exchange. </strong>Technology products and services aren't marketed via traditional advertising today. Technology marketing is based on knowledge exchange. This knowledge exchange has content at it's core as opposed to traditional advertising, allowing technology buyers to understand products and services being marketed in context of how they would use them.</li>
	<li><strong>The Laws of Physics Still Appl</strong><strong>y.</strong> Yes there are new marketing applications, new combinations and new techniques that have emerged but the laws of marketing physics still apply. The goal of technology marketing today is the same as it's always been. Reach key prospects, engage them, develop a relationship and turn these relationships into customer relationships. And as always your current customers are likely your best future customers.</li>
</ul>
One more thought. While these are clearly tough times given the challenges in the global economy, most everyone I meet with retains a strong pragmatic optimism and a focus on innovation. No one is standing still in this market. Feel free to add your thoughts on technology marketing today.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[I recently posted "<em>So I'm getting requests on Linkedin to professionally recommend people I haven't worked with or talked to in 15 years. Ahh is it just me or does this lack a bit of authenticity?"</em>. Almost immediately after posting this to Facebook and Twitter, I received a ton of responses, via posts to the thread on Facebook, replies on Twitter and private posts to my email accounts.

Comments ranged from Irene Koehler of <a href="http://almostsavvy.com/">Almost Savvy </a>who stated simply in a reply on Twitter: <em>"@TonyUphoff: It is wrong. Only recommend those you really know on LinkedIn"</em>. John Evan Frook, digital media pioneer, journalist and former colleague responded: <em>"What is wrong with “this was 15 years ago but,” or working it that way. Does your hesitancy, given that context, reveal as much about you as them? Just consider, Tony"</em>. To Jeff Sweat of Yahoo -and a former colleague- who humorously poked me with <em>" Just goes with the territory, Chief. By the way, we worked together 10 years ago. Just in case, you know, it happens to come up"</em>.  There were tons more including some truly thoughtful responses as well as some screamingly funny ones that had me laughing out loud. Clearly this post struck a chord. Understandably so.

<a title="Tony Uphoff" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=601148326"></a>

In this extraordinarily difficult economy, the need to professionally network is more important than ever. The question is, how do you best do this today in an era of increased transparency driven by the web? An automated, electronic form letter, asking for a recommendation lacks authenticity and ultimately credibility in today's world. Smacks of the log rolling that is common in book publishing where one author gushes over another authors recently released book; "ironically" with both authors sharing the same publisher.

The web has driven a whole new level of consumer information by enabling a limitless range of customer reviews. From movies, music and television, to hotels, cars and travel, to the best companies to work for it's simple to find unfiltered customer feedback and reviews. The web has also driven increased transparency however. While not infallible, it's easier to spot the inauthentic in today's web based world. Corporate marketing posing as a consumer review, the CEO blog that is ghost written and Twitterers for hire to name a few.

So based on the comments and input received from my post, here are 5 quick tips for professional networking in a web based world:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Be Authentic. </strong>This is not a commentary on your resume' but rather on your references and recommendations. List people you have significant experience with and who actually have an up to date knowledge of your work and skills. The recommendations that start off with " I worked with Sally Smith 15 years ago at ACME Media and found her to be..." are a waste of time. They aren't taken seriously and frankly reflect poorly on both the recommender as well as the person being recommended.</li>
	<li><strong>Understand the Difference Between a Reference and a Recommendation. <span style="font-weight: normal;">A form letter recommendation has truly limited value. A list of professional references however, who have tangible knowledge of your work could be invaluable. Note to Linkedin here...Drop the "recommend me" feature and replace it with a "professional reference feature". </span></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Network Naturally, Not Just When You Need it Most. </strong>We have all been in situations where we needed to tap our network of professional contacts. Looking for a new job, trying to sell to new clients, reaching out for references on an applicant or for input on a business deal, are all instances where professional networks are invaluable. These networks serve as the lifeblood of all businesses. Networking by definition however is not a one time activity. It's ongoing. If I call or write someone I haven't been in contact with for many years, I shouldn't expect that they are going to have an up to date perspective on my work. As a result I should be realistic about their level of interest in wanting to help me. If there is some tangible business benefit for them, then the reintroduction will likely be met with openness and gratitude. If on the other hand, I'm looking for a business favor that holds no material value for them other than "goodwill" I have to expect that it will have limited priority for them. I also have to expect that my contact will cause them to wonder why if I saw them as valuable in my network, I haven't been in contact before now.</li>
	<li><strong>Value Professional Reputations: Yours and Others. </strong>One response I received from the original post  posed the question; <em>"what's the harm in making a recommendation for someone who needs it, even if you don't know them that well?"</em>. In today's world it's obvious when someone doesn't really know the person they are recommending. Take a look at the vast majority of recommendations on Linkedin. They are worthless because they lack credibility. Reputations and careers are built on credibility.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't Send a Form Letter. </strong>I don't imagine that most of you would send a form letter or email when applying for a job, or reaching out to a customer or client of significance. You would customize and personalize your approach to the person you are communicating with. If you feel that a recommendation via one of the online professional networking sites would really help you, reach out personally to the people you want to recommend you. If you haven't talked with them in awhile, drop them a personal email and or call. Let them know what you've been up to, update your experience with them and ask if they would be comfortable providing a recommendation or serving as a reference. If they say yes, provide them with a brief outline of your career highlights, noting the experiences you had working with them.</li>
</ol>
What would you add to this list? Networking in any format is a tricky process and one fraught with personal and professional complexities. Today it's more important than ever though and with the new technologies available even easier. Social media tools can be misused however and end up ironically creating an impersonal, automated experience that actually works against creating the kind of authentic, valuable introductions, referrals and recommendations that are essential in business. Let me know how you think professional networking works best in this era of transparency.

<strong>Update on Friday, May 1, 2009 by Tony Uphoff:</strong>

Some really interesting discussions from the original post <a href="http://tuphoff.squarespace.com/uphoffonmediacom/2009/4/25/will-you-recommend-me-5-tips-for-professional-networking-in.html">"Will you Recommend Me: 5 tips for Business Networking in the Era of Transparency". </a> Several thought provoking responses to the blog as well as people posting to Facebook, Linkedin and to my email accounts, their thoughts on the topic. John Evan Frook wrote a particularly thoughtful post to the blog that is worth reading. John has an interesting take on the process for evaluating a recommendation and the criteria. Even if his "recommendation" at the end may or may not be misguided :).

Several key points have come out of this discussion:
<ul>
	<li>Recommendations are key to any relationship. The question is not whether to recommend. That now, as its always been, is a personal choice and decision. It's how to maintain your sense of authenticity and reputation in a world where the digitally distributed recommendation may lack credibility.</li>
	<li>There is a huge difference in transparency today. A recommendation on a site is a digital record that has wide distribution and virtually lasts forever. This carries for more complexity than the recommendation letter in a file or a phone call. In the process of visiting colleges with our daughter over the last year, I was amazed to see the looks on kids faces when administrators asked if they realized that colleges were looking at their My Space and Facebook profiles. These are digital trails that last and can be accessed way out of context from the original intent.</li>
	<li>The speed, power and functionality of social media is extraordinary in driving business and social networking. It can also become so easy that it actually declines in authenticity and value however.</li>
</ul>
Thanks to all of the people who added to the discussion here. Please feel free to keep it going.

				The Tipping Point		</title>

				<![CDATA[Lots of buzz in media and internet circles over the last 2 days over the <a href="http://www.webguild.org/index.php/2010/03/16/facebook-now-top-site-in-us/">announcement</a> that Facebook passed Google in traffic, becoming the leading Web destination in the US. There are as many people who predicted that this would happen as there are people who are shocked that it did.  Regardless of how you view Facebook, the reality is that it has become an extraordinary platform for consumer web interest. Facebook's passing Google represents a significant event. One that we may well look back on as a tipping point. Exactly what has driven the growth of Facebook-as one could argue at the expense of Google- is a fascinating discussion and debate for media and Internet professionals and those that follow the industry.  So here is my take...

Facebook's overtaking of Google is a reflection of people being more interested in what their social graph is doing, saying and passionate about, than in "searching" the web.  The elegance of the Facebook platform is a "post search" model. One in which you have already defined what you are interested in by *who* you are interested in, so "search" becomes an aspect of the people in your social graph. The idea of "searching the web" has lost resonance for most regular web users...which is basically all of us. The next generation of search has yet to really emerge. New visual search applications and extraordinary improvements in search technology continue, yet none have captured the scale of Google's core search algorithms. This milestone in social network traffic suggests a true change in interest and behavior. It may also suggest a post search world where the social graph, branded content networks and other destinations reflect what Web users are "searching" for and once found where they focus their time and interests. Let me know your thoughts on Facebook surpassing Google. Much ado about nothing or a tipping point?]]>		</content:encoded>

				A Gutenberg Moment		</title>

				<![CDATA[In a recent interview long time media pro and founder of MarketWatch.com Larry Kramer provided <a href="http://wallstcheatsheet.com/knowledge/interview-knowledge/exclusive-media-legend-larry-kramer-says-media-business-is-in-a-gutenberg-moment/?p=8087/">some thoughtful insights on the state of media today</a>. He says we are in the midst of a "Gutenberg Moment" where everything is changing based on new technology. He puts forth the idea of 4 "C's" (why do media and technology guru's love lists of "C"'s in order to describe their market transitions?!) in media today.
<ol>
	<li>Consumer</li>
	<li>Curation</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Convergence</li>
</ol>
Kramer also talks about the shift in media from standard offerings to services. This shift is exponentially accelerating due to technology, leaving some media companies wrestling with how to scale a services business. Hmmm. Sound like anyone you know?

Kramer's eloquent market observations and clever "A Gutenberg Moment" definition are spot on. We are indeed experiencing a prolonged series of market transitions in media based on advances in technology. A series of "Gutenberg moments" if you will. These transitions aren't linear either. They are disruptive at their inception, then play out over time. Sometimes in surprising ways. Two timely examples here worth reflecting on:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=what_is_linkedin&amp;trk=hb_what">LinkedIn</a>. When this brand was first established, it appeared that the registration engine and the network that was created would hold potential for all sorts of revenue streams. Contextual advertising and market research on specific B2B communities where two that were most often touted. The announcement that <a href="http://www.research-live.com/news/news-headlines/linkedin-shutters-b2b-survey-sample-service/4002374.article">LinkedIn has quietly retreated from B2B research </a>is telling. Perhaps they have learned that a recruitment platform by another name is still a recruitment platform. I still see LinkedIn as a Dice and Monster.com killer, not a broad media and business information platform. But time will tell.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">Apple iPad</a>. Ok, so I'll admit up front that I'm a technology and gadget geek, as my family, friends and colleagues will attest! Having sat at the intersection between technology and media for 20 years however, I can also sense a market transition when I see one. Make no mistake about it, the iPad will be a game changer. And not simply because the elegance of the UI and features of the iPad will make the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Kindle</a> look like an "etch o sketch" by comparison. The difference is in Apple's ability to organize content markets. Amazon, a very smart and successful digital retailer, isn't in the business of organizing markets. And their approach to the Kindle reflects this. The Kindle is simply an extension of their core business, providing digital access to retail goods and services. Kindle allows you to get books digitally. Period.  With the iPod, the iPhone and soon to be the iPad, Apple has used a platform to organize a digital market for end users as well as both traditional publishers and individual publishers. From music in iTunes to applications in the app store, Apple has a strong vision for creating a large, scalable market. Yes there are issues around how open these markets are and friends of mine who are particularly advanced in open source approaches have found flaws in the Apple approach. In terms of actually scaling a market however, you can't argue with the success they have seen. My sense-and clearly the perspective of a ton of other people-is that we are about to see Apple organize the next digital marketplace with the iPad as a platform. While the iPad isn't the first "e-reader" it may well represent the missing link between print and online that most of us have been talking about for years. Bear in mind that it wasn't that long ago that people laughed at the idea of the iPod and iTunes. I remember reading smug analyst reports on the "folly of Steve Job's ambition". Some folly. Also remember that Steve Jobs is Disney's largest shareholder and sits on the board. Talk about ambition. Will the iPad truly be a game changer for digital content? Here as well, only time will tell.</li>
</ul>
So what "Gutenberg moments" are you seeing? How are you harnessing these extraordinary advances in technology for your business? Are you developing an iPad strategy for your media business?]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Media-Application Era Has Arrived		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2010/04/17/the-media-application-era-has-arrived/</link>

				<![CDATA[ The first phase of online media was defined by "Reach".Value was based on unique visitor reach and the page views generated. The second phase was defined by  "Search",  where value was derived by optimizing content to drive search results. We are now officially in the "Media-Application" era, where value is created by engaging audiences around applications of content and services that become part of their regular media consumption. This market transition represents a fundamental shift that is setting off a series of changes that will realign the power base in media, technology and advertising for years to come.  

Google served as the center of gravity in the Search driven era of media. While it's not clear yet which company will take that position in the media-application era,  <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is making a strong case.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook </a>was really the first scalable  media-application that we've seen. <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> another example, has had a similar explosive growth in adoption. More narrow media-applications are now also gaining traction, like location-based applications <a href="http://foursquare.com/">FourSquare</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>. All of these examples share common traits; rapid consumer adoption and at the same time, the lack of a clear and scalable revenue model. Most everyone assumes that contextual social graph recommendation advertising and location based advertising, leveraging mobile positioning, will eventually be the way these  media-applications make money. As usual Apple has a different approach and perhaps they have hit on the most scalable model of all.

Wait a second, Apple is in the device business not advertising you say? No need to remind you that it wasn't that long ago that people were confused when Apple announced they were getting into the music business. The full scope of Apple's ambition became clear when they announced the <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2010/04/five_reasons_th_1.html;jsessionid=PRSC1DHD5DZHLQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN?queryText=ipad">iPad</a> and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2010/04/apples_next_big.html;jsessionid=PRSC1DHD5DZHLQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN?queryText=ipad">iAd Network </a>and the new <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/smart_phones/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224201325&amp;queryText=ipad">OS for the iPhone</a>. With 3G iPhone's and iPads, over <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/billion-app-countdown/">1Billion applications downloaded</a> and growing, the announcement of an ad network makes sense. Apple will now have the ability to put ads into applications, provide location based advertising and provide an interactive and customizable experience with advertising for consumers. And they will provide a platform and network to allow content and marketing application developers of all sorts to build businesses and in turn scale the market.

Make no mistake Google will not be left in the dust here. They have already started testing location based advertising in Google Maps in Australia and they have been working with rich-media advertising applications for awhile now. Remember that little acquisition a few years ago called YouTube? They are <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/05/youtube-revenue-2010/">approaching $1 Billion</a> in revenue and growing.  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-37543-Columbus-Technology-Examiner~y2010m4d16-Googles-Android-Market-nears-40000-apps-reports-Nexus-One-phone-is-profitable">Google's Android </a>was clearly launched with the future of the application-based media era in mind. And while the application downloads pale in comparison to Apple's iPhone, they recently surpassed the 40,00 mark and say that the Nexus One phone has reached profitability.

So people get ready. The media-application era has officially launched. And as with most market transitions, it represents both threat and opportunity for existing media, marketing and technology businesses.]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's interesting to see how Apple's rapidly become a significant media publisher with the advent of iPhone and iPad applications that serve up news from newspapers and magazines. 

One area I find a little unnerving is that Apple, via its developer agreements, has the ability to remove an app from its app store at any time, for any reason. Will Apple use that power in the future to remove apps from newspapers/magazines that are critical of Apple?  Time will tell. I wouldn't put it past Jobs.]]></wp:comment_content>

				The Future of Live Media		</title>

				<![CDATA[Talk about an audacious headline! I was asked by <a href="http://cemaonline.com/">CEMA</a>: The Corporate Event Marketing Association, to host a panel discussion on this daunting topic at our Interop Exhibition and Conference in Las Vegas this week. My panelists; Travis Goodrich: Advertising Manager at  <a href="http://www.procurve.com/">HP's ProCurve</a>, Lorna Pierno: Director of Marketing Programs at <a href="http://www.xirrus.com/">Xirrus </a>and Steve Garrison: VP of Marketing at <a href="http://www.force10networks.com/company/">Force 10 Networks</a> and I led a discussion with a group of corporate marketing executives about the future of live media. Here are a few of my takeaways from the discussion:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Next Generation Digital Media in a Traditional Media Wrapper: </strong>The definition of live media is evolving rapidly. It now encompasses both face to face and virtual events. Not all attendees had participated in a virtual event. Those that had were fans and saw virtual events as good additional marketing vehicles. Some that hadn't, expressed trepidation about virtual events. It's clear that live events have become multi-media platforms, with marketers organizing marketing programs around events, with extensions in digital, online, print and social media. One executive from a large technology company noted that they view specific events today as "marketing platforms". They develop strategic marketing campaigns; organizing product introductions,  public relations, online advertising, print advertising and analyst briefings, around these "marketing platforms".</li>
	<li> <strong>Branded Response: </strong>Marketers view live media as an opportunity to brand their company, products and services <strong><em>and</em></strong> drive their sales pipelines. Attendees articulated that live media provides a platform for marketers to present a strong, contextual narrative to customers, as well as create an environment for engagement and discussion. In real time. Marketers are increasingly extending customer engagements from live events-nurturing the lead if you will-via integrated digital, online and print programs, that support the messaging from the live event. There were also several discussions about the challenge of managing the expectations of developing the "sales pipeline" at a live event, within their company.</li>
	<li> <strong>The Use of Social Media: </strong>While most every event marketer attending was using social media in concert with their live event marketing, metrics continue to be illusive. One panelist said that they are using twitter, facebook, blogs and other social media applications to enhance their live event marketing.  However they consider the metrics they gather to be "soft metrics". There was also an interesting discussion about the use of social media by employees in support of live event marketing. Tweeting and posting to support the marketing appeared to be encouraged by most of the companies in attendance. But these same companies have yet to set strict guidelines for usage.</li>
	<li> <strong>Marketing Mix: </strong>A rough estimate would suggest that live events represent 50% of the overall marketing budgets of those attending. Most felt live events would stay at this percentage for 2011. Several panelists and attendees mentioned a stronger focus around "core" or "tier 1"events and putting more marketing efforts into those events. Marketers also shared their challenges in dealing with silo-ed marketing budgets within their companies that makes developing and managing integrated campaigns difficult.</li>
</ul>
The consensus from the panelists and attendees?  The future of live media is bright.  New technologies and new marketing concepts are driving innovation and to an extent redefining what live media is. In some respects there appears to be a rediscovery of the power of live media. Perhaps a feeling that in an increasingly fragmented media world the value of engaging with communities of high demographic buyers in a live format is going up. My thanks to my panelists, the folks from CEMA and to the attendees. It was a great discussion and we look forward to keeping this dialogue going.]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Tony, so far I've been underwhelmed by the user experience of most "virtual event" platforms. I believe that the virtual event concept has promise, but the implementation needs to be free of the typical legacy thinking (the virtual booth, etc) that attempts to mimic the traditional trade show model. The benefits of virtual events can potentially exceed the usual low-cost production incentive, but only if creative people choose to apply it from a truly forward-looking point of view.

cheers, David]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments David. I agree that the early work in virtual trade show platforms has been rudimentary at best. We've done some pioneering work in this area that has resulted in our building an internal division and creating a joint venture with one of the leading platform suppliers, InXpo. I'll be posting a presentation and perspective from our learning in a blog post in the near future. Keep your comments and ideas coming.

				Marketing as a Service		</title>

				<![CDATA[Marketing is going through the biggest revolution in the last 75 years. The laws of physics; reach and frequency, branding and call to action have been upended and a mashup of  lead generation, content, customer analysis, relationship management and social engagement is creating a new era in marketing. Technology is acting as both a disruptive force and an enabling platform in this marketing revolution and we are still in the early stages.

There are 3 foundational trends that are emerging in this new marketing era:
<ol>
	<li><strong>From Mad Men to Math Men: </strong>Marketing has become metric based. From Internet impressions to click-trough's to downloads to engagement marketers are awash in data. At the same time there are new tools for analyzing, adjusting and refining marketing in real time that are blending the art of advertising the with the science of analytics.</li>
	<li><strong>Content is Marketing. Marketing is Content: </strong>Marketing a complex, expensive and highly differentiated product or service requires telling a compelling and multi-faceted story. The skills required to do this are centered around content. The ability to create a story that engages and sustains audiences are the same skills required for creating a brand or product story that engages and sustains interest from prospects and customers.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketing as a Service: </strong>Marketing as a one-way broadcast model, done in a series of campaigns simply doesn't work anymore. Successful marketing today requires a content centric, conversational approach that engages and sustains a community of prospects, customers and vendors around mutual interest and the quality of the content exchange. In other words once a brand has engaged prospects and customers with a compelling story, this "community" needs to be sustained and nurtured. This shifts marketing from a project and campaign orientation to marketing as an ongoing service. The key is to be able to build, sustain and curate these communities and engage them on and off line.</li>
</ol>
Given the early adopting markets we serve at <a href="http://www.ubmtechweb.com/">UBM TechWeb</a> we've been actively engaged in these foundational shifts in marketing for several years. And we have the scars to prove it! We have also been doing research on technology professionals use of media and how they engage with marketing that helped us develop our own approach to Marketing as a Service. We post this research as well as interviews with CMO's of technology companies and case studies of various marketing approaches on our site: <a href="http://createyournextcustomer.techweb.com/">Create Your Next Customer</a>. Feel free to log on on, take a look and give us your feedback. And as always, please also drop me a note at Uphoff on Media and let me know your thoughts on Marketing as a Service.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[At some point "New Media" is no longer new. "Emerging Media" emerges. Describing the revolutionary trends that have been driving the media industry over the last decade as either "new" or "emerging" is inaccurate and misleading. Media companies have either embraced and harnessed digital platforms and technology or they haven't.  The Internet revolution has resulted in 4 types of media companies today: The Dead, The Wounded, The Surviving and The Thriving. So what attributes best define a thriving media company?  What will they be in the media company of the future?

 We were recently asked by <a href="http://www.americanbusinessmedia.com/abm/Default.asp">American Business Media</a> to share some of our experiences and thoughts on the media company of the future at their recent San Francisco meeting. While I gave the presentation at the meeting, the ideas shared were the collective wisdom of the great minds in <a href="http://www.ubmtechweb.com/">UBM TechWeb </a>and our sister companies within <a href="http://www.ubm.com/">UBM</a>. Here is the presentation in slide format as well as a narrative. Let us know your thoughts and feel free to add to this list.

So as we embark on the future, a bit of history is needed to set the stage. The "Big Bang Event" in media happened in August of 1995. Since this date, there has been nearly $1 Trillion dollars in value destruction in general media. And 15 years later the revolution is still taking place. August of 1995 was when Netscape went public and while Netscape was ultimately not a survivor of the revolution they helped to create, they ignited a shift in the center of gravity in media. Certainly for publishers that shift was from print to digital. This market transition also led  the shift from media platforms to platforms of engagement however.  While publishers talked a good game about audience engagement and understanding, they were for the most part totally unprepared for this transition. Models flipped from push to pull. Reach took on a new meaning and web metrics became the new math of media. Ultimately this Web based transition drove three rapid eras in media:
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Reach Era:</strong> The first phase of online media was defined by “Reach”. Value was based on unique visitor reach and the page views generated.</li>
	<li><strong>The Search Era:</strong> The second phase was defined by  ”Search”,  where value was derived by optimizing content to drive search results.</li>
	<li><strong>The Media-Application Era:</strong> We are now officially in the “Media-Application” era, where value is created by engaging audiences around applications of content and services that become part of their regular media consumption.</li>
</ul>
So with this bit of history, how about that media company of the future? Here are the 15 attributes that we feel define the successful media company of today as well as the media company of the future:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Content Will Still Be King. Again. But Applications Will be the Power Behind the Throne</strong>: In a post search world, there is a flight to content quality, trusted brands and networks. The growth of the social graph is a clear example of this trend. Understanding how to best harness media applications as engagement platforms and distribution networks will be key however.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad </a>anyone?</li>
	<li><strong>UI/UEX Will Matter. A Lot: </strong>The first phase of Internet "media" has been abysmal in User Interface design and User Experience. Google, Facebook, the iPad and other examples teach us that the UI matters and will actually increase in importance. The need to focus on UI/UEX is not exclusive to web based media either. Magazines, live events and other content deliverables also need to deliver increasing value in their UI and UEX.</li>
	<li><strong>Live Media Plays a Central Role: </strong>Scarcity drives all markets and aggregating high demographic audiences together in a live format is an increasing scarcity in a fragmented media world.  The natural progression of social media and integrated media is live media. The media company of the future will have live media as a "natural" core.</li>
	<li><strong>All Access. All the Time. One Subscrption. All Devices. All Environments: </strong>Audiences today want a frictionless registration and subscription process, single sign on functionality and the ability to access all of their media, in all it's formats, across all devices. This is rapidly moving from a "want" to a "demand".</li>
	<li><strong>Search Will Matter Less Than Content and UI/UEX:</strong>People are far more interested today in what trusted brands, and the people in their social graph have to say than they are in "searching" the web. There are a generation of web media brands that have optimized content to game out search engines. As a result they are a hodge podge of search friendly language, terms and headlines, with limited abililty to sustain an organic audience.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated Media is the Standard:</strong> We have lived in an integrated media world since the advent of smoke signals and drawings on cave walls. Today however integrated media is the norm, with digital, print, online and live events, intersecting in increasingly innovative and valuable ways. If you don't help your audiences integrate their media, someone else will.</li>
	<li><strong>Media is Technology. The Moment of "Singularity" Has Happened: </strong>If you are running a media company and don't have a CIO as one of your direct reports, hire one. Now.</li>
	<li><strong>Curation is Editing. Editing is Curation: </strong>User generated content is great. Until it's not. Not all users are experts. Not all experts are articulate. Editors today need to curate great content and that includes curating user generated content.</li>
	<li><strong>Media Platforms to Revenue Platforms:</strong>Media companies need to shift from focusing on media platforms to focusing on revenue platforms. From marketing to marketing services to business information; these are revenue platforms that then determine what media platforms most effectively deliver these services to audiences and marketers.</li>
	<li><strong>Everybody Sells Everyday. Everybody Writes Everyday:</strong> Regardless of your role; from content, to marketing, to sales, to development, everyone serves customers; be they audiences or marketers. As a result everyone "sells" everyday. At the same time, the best companies use a version of crowd sourcing. Harnessing the best ideas and collective thinking of the group and sharing this knowledge. For this to work, everybody has to "write" everyday and this intelligence needs to be captured, stored and produced in ways that allow people to leverage it.</li>
	<li><strong>Paid. That's Right, Paid: </strong>People always have and always will pay for high quality content. Having paid content as a significant part of a media business creates a core understanding of your audiences that helps guide all aspects of the business.</li>
	<li><strong>Regionally Focused. Globally Connected: </strong>All markets are inherently regional. Focus on the regions that matter and serve those regions locally. Then  focus on connecting to global resources and partners that allow you to serve other regions. Then repeat. Also remember, just because it works in the US does not mean it will work in another region of the world.</li>
	<li><strong>No Debt. Or VERY Manageable Debt: </strong>The level of value destruction in general as well as business to business media has been and continues be shocking. Even with the recent debt restructurings of some of the Private Equity backed media companies, many are still carrying way too heavy debt loads, restricting their ability to build sustainable businesses. To assume that the crushing debt loads that many companies have operated under hasn't caused irreparable brand, cultural and company damage is ludicrous.</li>
	<li><strong>Less is More:</strong> Look to scale up first. Not out.</li>
	<li><strong>Same as its Always Been. Great Media Company = Great Team of People: </strong>The value in media brands and businesses are in the teams that create, run and drive them. During a time of tumultuous change, with the added complexity of a global recession, it's not always easy to attract, retain and develop talent. It is the key however and as hard as it can be at times, should always be the primary focus.</li>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A couple of observations, which riff off of your "content is king" theme:  The Web is becoming more atomized -- more sites/devices clamoring for attention. As a result, there's an element of reader confusion in play currently, which I think medium-term will drive them back even more to trusted brands. The second is my belief that the home page as the uber-destination is dying, and in its place, the platform (ipad) is rising. So, to look at your "apps will be the power behind the throne" statement another way, I think content and apps will begin to merge. (They'll become intertwined, inseparable. . .The content is the application, if you  will.)]]></wp:comment_content>

				<![CDATA[Y2K was the tipping point. Extraordinary innovations in processing power, storage capacity, networking capability and software applications had driven a growth phase in Enterprise technology that suddenly came to a screeching halt. Innovation ceased and many Enterprises faced the reality that Y2K hysteria, combined with an overreaction to the first phase of the web had driven a glut of technology purchasing. Enterprise technology decision makers turned their focus inward, working to integrate disparate systems, cut costs, drive efficiencies, rationalize ROI and hang on to their jobs. What ensued was a lost decade. Technology innovation didn't stop however. It simply moved on.

Advances in UI, mobile computing, wireless, broadband and a new generation of social networking, distribution and publishing applications sprang up, as Web 2.0 defined a new era of innovation and creativity in technology. The majority of these new technologies were adopted in the consumer marketplace. As Web 2.0 brought confirmation that the web had become the computational platform however, the Enterprise market awoke from it's decade long slumber. Early adopting Enterprises started taking Web 2.0 applications and platforms and adapting them for business. Enterprise technology vendors weren't sitting idly by either. Bold new technologies like Cloud Computing, SaaS, Virtualization, Unified Communications, enhanced Business Intelligence and advances in Rapid Software and Web Development ignited a new wave of innovation and the Enterprise 2.0 era took off.

Business growth in the "lost decade" was driven primarily by mergers and acquisitions. Business growth today is driven by collaboration. Organizations need to be nimble, agile and adaptable in order to collaborate and drive growth. Success in business now is defined by the ability to create a collaborative team across the entire ecosystem; including employees, customers, suppliers and influencers. In essence The Enterprise needs to become "social".  This requires a new approach. A new operating system is needed for "The Social Enterprise". Social Business Software is an emerging category that best defines the platforms and tools that will fuel the social enterprise. It is a category we think will accelerate rapidly in the next few years as businesses of all sizes look to fuel collaboration and drive growth.

This week in Boston we will be hosting our <a href="http://www.e2conf.com/">Enterprise 2.0 Conference</a>, which is focused on helping people and organization harness technology to create and manage the social enterprise. It's the largest gathering for people looking to leverage 2.0 technologies to connect teams and harness collective intelligence and provides visionary keynotes, informative sessions, case studies and an Expo Pavilion featuring the latest technologies from established leaders and innovative start-ups. I'll also be speaking this week at <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/getsocialtour">Jive Software's "Get Social"</a> event in Boston. My presentation is entitled "The Lost Decade" and touches on many of the themes outlined in this post. I'll include a copy of the slides here.  Let me know your thoughts on The Social Enterprise and what your company is doing to drive collaboration, agility and growth.

				<![CDATA[Jeff Jarvis recent post <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2010/07/24/advertising-is-next/">"Advertising is Next" </a> created significant buzz in media, marketing and advertising circles. Jeff-never one to mince words-suggested that advertising as we know it was...shall we just say, not in good shape. To provide a foundation for his argument, he lampoons the recent Conde Nast announcement, which calls for transforming the company from a media to commerce business. Putting aside the logic or efficacy of the Conde Nast strategy-perhaps a post for another time-Jeff actually raised some thoughtful questions about the state of advertising today and where the core of the industry is headed.

The art of creating an ad, practiced by a small, tightly knit fraternity of of agencies, most following philosophies put forth by genius's like Olgivy, Rubicam and Clow, has always been about creative vision and talent. Break through creative defined brands and mass media fueled the advertising boom. The golden age of the ad agency coincided with the extraordinary growth of television in the 1960's. Given the mono-media nature of the times, advertising <strong><em>was</em></strong> marketing back then, a history the hit AMC television show <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/">Mad Men</a> chronicles so beautifully. The science that supported media buying for advertising was well served by relatively simple research based metrics on print and television. In the mid 1990's, the introduction of the Internet, launched the next media revolution, but this mass reach medium proved to be a *far different* animal than television or print and the aftermath has left advertising in limbo.

As the Internet matured, the platform provided new information that allowed marketers access to real time data that blended traditional advertising statistics and direct marketing metrics. Traditional advertising that drove branding and awareness started to feel the pressure of click-through ratios, and action based metrics. Lead generation and performance marketing, long the bastion of "below the line" marketing, moved above the line. Branded response became the watchword. The impact of these changes is still being felt too.

Advertising has always worked best as a core part of marketing. The Internet isolated advertising however and called into question the value and the impact. While not always an easy or smooth process, the reality is, advertising is going through a necessary step, as marketers evolve their strategies post the media revolution the Internet created. Advertising needs to once again become part of a cohesive, integrated marketing program, one that today encompasses public relations, social media, content and multimedia efforts. Advertising needs to shift from a series of projects to a core component of marketing. And marketing needs to become a continual process, operating as an ongoing service. Successful marketers are now approaching "Marketing as a Service" similar to the Software as a Service offerings you see from companies like SalesForce.com. Advertising, content syndication, PR, social media and lead generation working together in a service model, with companies like <a href="http://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a> and <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/">Eloqua</a> providing analytics that help to guide and steer the process.

So while it's dramatic to suggest that advertising is dead, the idea misses the mark. Advertising is becoming marketing. Right where it should be.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<strong>"<em>I said maybe, you're the one to save me. And after all, you're my wonderwall".</em></strong><em>   </em>The chorus from the hit song "Wonderwall" by the band Oasis seems to have been written for today's daily newspaper industry.  <em> </em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/finally-some-hints-about-how-much-the-new-york-times-online-paywall-will-cost-2010-8">The New York Times </a>went public this week with their plans for a paywall starting in January 2011.  <a href="http://www.editorsweblog.org/newspaper/2010/01/financial_times_paywall_finally_pays_off.php">The Financial Times</a> an early pioneer in creating paywalls for online content claims that content revenue will surpass advertising revenue this year.  <a href="http://jeffnolan.com/wp/2010/07/20/paywalls-are-dumb-statistics-prove/">Rupert Murdoch's experiements</a> with online paywalls have gotten mixed reviews. Tough to articulate a 60% drop in traffic as a positive.

Different than all other print media, daily newspapers have always been marketed at impulse buy prices. To this day $1.00 is the average newsstand price for a daily newspaper.  This low-cost/high value tradition for daily newspapers creates a particularly challenging dynamic as they look to create paywalls for their online versions. Newspaper businesses continue to claim that readers have always “paid” for their news by purchasing a newspaper. This is false; readers pay for the convenience of having the content delivered — advertisers have footed the bill for content creation. 

So now daily newspapers have to convince you that the content value is actually higher than you thought. Or they need to appeal to your sense of fairness, that based on a changing media landscape, you need to pay more. Trying to convince people to pay more; or pay at all, for content they have gotten for a relatively low, or no, price simply doesn't scale. I'd argue that other than perhaps The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the New York Times, there are few-if any-daily newspapers that will be able to make this transition. And it's not entirely clear what the business on the other side of this transition will look like either.  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aKnLb7Zqtfv4">Murdoch's</a> sabre rattling with Google and other search engines is not without logic. In the early 1980's people laughed at the idea of paying for television. 30 years later cable television rules the airwaves. Will there come a time when carriage fee models emerge online as they did in cable? It's possible. I wouldn't hold my breath however.

Perhaps Oasis was writing about the newspaper business after all. The next verse of Wonderwall: <strong>"<em>Today was going to be the day. But they'll never throw it back to you. By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do. I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now". </em></strong>]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[So a friend of mine is the online director for a major regional newspaper brand.  They just went to a gated model.  90% traffic drop.  Is that sustainable?  It's an awfully high wonderwall to climb.  For any but the most prestigious brands of daily (FT, NYT, WSJ), the trick will be a balance of marginal prices and volume.  That said, even if you charged $1 a year, getting someone to pull their cc out of their wallet to pay for content is a huge dilution event in the registration funnel - tough to overcome.  Until someone comes up with a itunes style preloaded payment system for media, that cc-wallet obstacle is going to be a constant sticking point...

What a minute.  Business idea, anyone?]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[There needs to be some training about what constitutes valuable content.  last week there was an article in a paper that I frequent for free on line, and that has instituted a paywall for "unique" content.  There was an article that seemed interesting from the headline and as I was reading I learned that it was about a press event that several journalists attended.  After the second graph I saw a link to see the rest of the story after I subscribed.  Rather than do that, I did a search for a couple of key words and found the entire story at another publication, completely for free.  Coverage of events frequented by scores of journalists is not quality content.  It's fodder for the herd.]]></wp:comment_content>

				<![CDATA[Clive Thompson's piece in the recent issue of Wired on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/07/st_thompson_deadphone/">"Death of the Phone Call"</a> illuminated some fascinating trends about cell phone use. Nielsen research shows that the number of cell phone calls hit a peak in 2007 and has declined each year since. Voice calls are also getting shorter, averaging half the time they did 5 years ago. While voice calls have declined over this period, texting has grown at an astounding rate.  To an extent this was predictable.  "Killer apps" drive all markets and texting became the app that drove the data services market for cell phones. Just ask any parent of a teenager and they will tell you a story about receiving a $300.00 + cell phone bill based on junior texting like mad. But what drove adoption of texting? Is it a millennial thing and the rest of us just wouldn't understand? Each generation-my own included- thinks they really are "special". The adoption of texting isn't a generational phenomenon though. It's actually a natural evolution in communication.

A phone call is obtrusive unless you are expecting it. There is an inherent risk in calling someone. They may not be available, you might be interrupting them and they may be totally unprepared to react to your call. As Thompson notes in his article, the vast majority of voice calls are calls to see if someone is available to talk.  Texting on the other hand is far less intrusive. People can react on their own time. The sender can save face if the receiver doesn't respond back immediately. The person receiving the text can take the time to read and react before responding...Minus the "oh, uh, yea, well you know...let me call you back" that typifies the average unsolicited phone call. Voicemail? Forget it. Voicemail is truly the voice application that is getting completely disinter-mediated.  Nielsen data shows that more than a fifth of all voicemails are never listened to.

My own use of texting has risen exponentially in the last 2 years...And not just because we have a 19 year old daughter! Short form communication, that traditionally was handled via a quick phone call, has been replaced by the text. In both business and personal communication. The reality is texting is a more "natural" way for contacting someone in unobstrusive way.  So ET, text home instead of calling. Your people will appreciate it.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Social Enterprise		</title>

				<![CDATA[Business is a collaborative sport. Always has been, always will be. Growth in business, whether from new customers, new products, new efficiencies or by acquisition requires collaboration. Business school case studies are founded on examples of successful or unsuccessful collaborations. The challenge is encouraging, coordinating and enabling collaboration is incredibly hard. Through the years technology breakthroughs have driven new levels of business collaboration and the rare profound breakthrough has created a market transition that truly changed the way people and organizations work. We are in the midst of one of these market transitions now. We call it "The Social Enterprise".

Social media is following the same adoption curve that the Internet did. The Internet gained commercial traction as a consumer platform. As it reached a critical mass in the consumer market, enterprises started to evaluate use of the Internet as a business platform. A series of enterprise adoption phases followed. The Internet was hailed as a revolution and a fad. The Internet was a polarizing platform fueling debate in business, academia, the general media and around the family dinner table. In business ROI metrics were questioned and the platform was deemed both a revolutionary innovation and a massive threat to productivity. Several stages of adoption played out including the "dressing Grandma up in a mini-skirt" phase. You remember that one don't you? That's when most every company self consciously put dotcom in their name in an attempt to position the business for the dotcom gold rush. The stock market reminded us that the Internet, like all significant market transitions, could be both over-hyped and under-hyped. By 2003, these awkward adoption phases were over. The Internet had simply become the computational platform for all businesses and enterprise adoption was no longer a debate.

<strong><em>The Social Enterprise</em></strong>: We see the same dynamics playing out with the adoption of social platforms, tools and applications in the enterprise market today. The consumer adoption of social media platforms and services like My Space, Facebook and Twitter reached critical mass. The launch of business social platforms and applications ignited the rapid series of enterprise adoption phases we are seeing today. The market adoption of The Social Enterprise however will happen faster and have a more profound impact on the way we work than the Internet did.

<strong><em>The Human Operating System</em></strong>: Simply put The Social Enterprise is a more natural way to work. Daniel Pink in his new book <a href="http://www.danpink.com/drive">"Drive"</a> writes about the innate need to solve problems and to collaborate with other human beings to do so.  Social platforms enable people to work in ways that are more in line with the way they naturally interact and work.  The self-publishing, crowd-sourcing, communications centric approach that The Social Enterprise provides, serves as a foundation for the ultimate collaborative platform, the human operating system. The power base in business today comes not from what you know, but rather from what you share. The Social Enterprise brings together the collective intelligence of the organization. It also creates a connected expert marketplace across businesses regardless of geography, time zone, or organizational structure, driving peer to peer exchanges based on knowledge and value.

<strong><em>Implications for Technology, Media and Marketing:</em></strong> The Social Enterprise will have a significant and lasting impact on technology, media and marketing. We are already seeing new social platform companies like <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a> and <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a> gain adoption in the enterprise market. We are also seeing major enterprise software companies like<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/mobility/wlan/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224200160&amp;queryText=ocs"> Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/interviews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227700179&amp;queryText=SAP">SAP</a>,<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/virtual/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227500595&amp;queryText=oracle"> Oracle</a> and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/crm/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227300380&amp;queryText=salesforce.com">Salesforce.com</a> add social features and functionality. The Social Enterprise will reshape the technology landscape and become the center of gravity for the way companies think about and position the products and services they produce. The Social Enterprise is also having a profound impact on how media is produced and how audiences interact with media. Social applications and tools have become new distribution networks as people become far more interested in trusted brands and what people in their social networks are reading, doing and thinking, than they are in "searching" the web. We will also see new opportunities for marketers as new platforms, tools and applications allow for conversational and contextual marketing to take place across media platforms and environments.

At <a href="http://www.ubmtechweb.com/">UBM TechWeb</a> we are helping people and organizations harness the power of The Social Enterprise. Our <a href="http://www.e2conf.com/">Enterprise 2.0 Conference</a> is the leading destination for enterprise buyers looking for collaborative technology solutions. We also produce ongoing research on the enterprise adoption of social applications and tools and share this research with technology marketers via ou<a href="http://createyournextcustomer.techweb.com/">r Create Your Next Customer</a> site. In the spirit of sharing what you know, please feel free to add your thoughts and experiences on The Social Enterprise.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Hollywood Is Still The TMZ		</title>

				<![CDATA[Last week "super-agent" Ari Emanuel spoke at our <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/web2/arielemanuel.jhtml">Web 2.0 Summit</a>. Emanuel, CEO of the talent agency <a href="http://www.wma.com/flash.html">WME</a> created by the merger of William Morris and Endeavour, is considered to be the most powerful deal maker in Hollywood.  At times however he sounded more like his fictional namesake <a href="http://www.hbo.com/entourage/index.html#/entourage/cast-and-crew/ari/index.html">Ari Gold</a> from the HBO series Entourage. The interview brought to light that while only 350 miles apart, Hollywood and The Silicon Valley are still two very different worlds.

The discussion quickly fell into a free versus paid content debate and got stuck there.  It's understandable that an agent who makes his living by getting the best deal possible for his clients would take a very strong and negative stance on free access to valuable and expensive content. At the same time this stance drove an equally strident reaction from the Internet industry crowd in the audience who questioned Emanuel's one-dimensional view of the issue. What ensued was a fascinating sociological study of two very different cultures. The interaction also demonstrated that Hollywood is still living in the TMZ;  The Thirty Mile Zone, the slang term coined years ago to reflect the view that Hollywood was ground zero for the global entertainment industry.

The cultural gap between Hollywood and The Silicon Valley is about the understanding of <strong><em>technology</em></strong> and <strong><em>talent</em></strong>. In Hollywood the term "technology" refers to capture, process and storage technology; the tools for filming, editing and storing filmed entertainment. Movie theatre's and television have controlled the distribution of filmed  entertainment since it's inception. Technology embraced outside of the basic movie theatre and television viewing experience hasn't historically been a concern for entertainment executives.  The VCR and DVD player?  Yes, the entertainment industry after years of legal action against manufacturers, came to realize they could make money off the devices. The VCR and DVD player ended up being fed by retail distribution however and didn't fundamentally change the industry's view of technology. If anything the boom in "home video" revenues via VCR and DVD players created a false sense of security. 15 years after the launch of the Internet, the entertainment industry is still struggling to understand what to do with the platform. Perhaps they feel that like HD and IMax, their distribution partners will harness the Internet and provide them a new platform to reach audiences.

In the Silicon Valley when you use the term talent, people think of developers or engineers who build branded technology products and applications. Talent has a direct connection to the company that hires them as opposed to being hired to work on a project packaged by an agent. In Hollywood the vast majority of people on a studio lot are there on a creative project. That project will last 18 months on average and in most cases the exact same combination of people will never work together again. The majority of people you see on the campus of the average technology company are employees, working on a product and will stay with the company over a period of years.

Taking questions at the end of his interview, Emanuel said he was spending time each month in the Silicon Valley, perhaps believing that if he visits regularly it will bridge the cultural divide. It's not enough. Hollywood will ultimately suffer the same fate that the music industry has unless they start truly embracing disruptive technologies. The Thirty Mile Zone is a compelling metaphor that was intended to reflect the talent , creativity and passion inside the 30 square miles around Hollywood. Unless the industry takes a far different look at technology however, the TMZ will be remembered as a walled garden built by insular executives who refused to acknowledge that the world outside was changing.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg is becoming a CEO before our very eyes. Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook has been a participant at our Web 2.0 Summit Conference for the last several years. This year however, in a discussion on stage with John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly, we saw Zuckerberg 2.0. A more mature, confident and articulate leader. Yes as some have observed he has obviously received significant media training. And yes, at times he was a bit mechanical in his answers and mannerisms. Frankly if the CEO of a company the size and scope of Facebook wasn't getting media training I'd be concerned. I well remember listening to Bill Gates, Michael Dell and Steve Jobs at similar stages of their development and all of them had to learn how to communicate, present and deal with the media. And none of them were "naturals" at one to many communication either. That generation of technology executive also wasn't dealing with the range of media that exists today. So take a look at the interview and watch a technology executive maturing into the role of a CEO.

				<![CDATA[If traffic is the metric of popularity, then our Web 2.0 Summit interview with Google CEO Eric Schimdt suggests he is still the most popular guy in the Internet economy. Our discussion with Schmidt, led by John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly, received the most traffic during the livecast and continues to be the most viewed video in the archives from the conference, which you can find at <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/web2/index.jhtml">InformationWeek.com</a>.

An interesting contrast to relative youngster and upstart Mark Zuckerberg CEO of Facebook, who's video interview I posted previously ; <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2010/12/zuckerberg-grows-up/">"Zuckerberg Grows Up"</a>, the interview with Schmidt struck a far more sober tone, reflecting the unique position that Google now holds. I've spent time with Eric through the years and have seen him interviewed many times. He seemed a bit agitated in this interview and was uncharacteristically dismissive at times. It's clear that the recent press on talent retention and privacy issues has gotten to him. Sitting in the front row watching the interview, Shakespeare's line "Heavy hangs the head that wears the crown" came to my mind.

John and Tim did a great job getting Eric to share his thoughts on mobile and the implications it has for search, payment and advertising. They also got his take on the application marketplace as well as his thoughts on talent retention at Google. He sets the record straight on the "raise issue" and said that the retention percentage at Google has not varied in the last 7 years. He noted that Google hires 200 people a week. Speaking of astounding stats, he also mentioned that there are over 35 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. Astounding. When asked about Apple Schmidt referred to being a "very proud former board member".

His comments on privacy and their approach to Google Street View are fascinating and reflect the still challenging nature of Internet privacy. Take a look and feel free to post your comments on how the CEO of Google views the Internet landscape today.

				<![CDATA[Seth Godin's recent post <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/everyone-and-no-one.html">"Everyone and No One"</a> captures the often times confusing reaction to new ideas. Innovation can create an odd polarization. Either <strong><em>Everyone Likes "it" </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">or </span></strong><strong><em>No One</em></strong><strong><em> Does</em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> . It's rare that you have a middle ground.</span> </strong>Seth's post made me wonder if this love it or hate it syndrome is most acute in those of us who work in areas of extraordinary creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, like The Silicon Valley, The Thirty Mile-Zone of Hollywood, Madison Avenue and Wall Street. It's easy to get caught up in the passion, intensity and sheer optimism that typify these environments and the industries they represent. It's also possible to develop myopia however and assume that everyone or perhaps no one "gets it".

It can be difficult to retain a sense of perspective when you spend the majority of your time in areas where discussions tend to reverberate around a small echo chamber of like minded people. This echo chamber mentality can also develop in people and organizations regardless of where they are based. The belief that "Everyone" or "No One" likes a new idea, be it yours or a competitors, can be an easy but dangerous trap to fall into. As an old boss of mine used to say...Righteous is probably somewhere in the middle.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Facebook Versus Google. It&#039;s About Scale		</title>

				<![CDATA[No question that in the search based web world the scale of Google has been breathtaking. One key question to ask though; are we still in a search based world? Feels awfully social to me these days. Facebook's model is scaling and will continue to for a couple of reasons:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Word of mouth</strong>. It's always been the most powerful form of marketing. Facebook's naturally viral model drives scale at levels we've never seen. Their traffic and current ad model scales for low CPM, transactional advertising and could challenge Google's throne in this area alone. Facebook has another advantage however. The power of someone(s) in your social graph "liking" a certain product has huge branding value for marketers and in turn opens up the potential for higher effective CPM's as FB scales. Google does not yet have a relative scalable answer as web advertising balances between lead gen and branding.</li>
	<li><strong>Facebook as a Service. </strong>The amount of revenue Facebook is generating in social gaming suggests that there are other, scalable, paid services companies can offer on the FB platform. Social gaming to "social services" isn't a big leap.</li>
</ul>]]>		</content:encoded>

				Media, Marketing &amp; Technology In 2010		</title>
		<link>http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2011/01/01/media-marketing-technology-in-2010/</link>

				<![CDATA[2010 has been an incredible year. It went by in a blink. The year started out with feelings of fear and dread and is ending with feelings of excitement and optimism. 2010 will be remembered as the year the media industry stopped talking about media transformation and started embracing it. As I noted in my presentation at the <a href="http://www.americanbusinessmedia.com/abm/Default.asp">ABM</a> New York meeting early this year; " It's no longer emerging media. It has emerged. You need to shift your world view of digital media as a disruptor to digital media as an enabler".

I'm not one for lengthy year end reviews or lists so I won't attempt that here. There are a few highlights from the year in Media, Marketing and Technology worth noting though:

<strong><em>Media</em><span style="font-weight: normal;">. 2010 will be remembered as the year of the social graph and the media application. In 2010 we realized that there </span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>is</em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> life after search and it feels quite social. The shift from search to social has created a new series of opportunities and challenges for media. Many web sites have bastardized their content in order to game out search engines. This SEO/SEM centric web-publishing model generates drive by traffic that is of very low value and too costly to generate and profitably sustain. The shift to the social web has brought back the power of word of mouth enabling a corollary flight to quality and brand. </span></strong>Content has always been king in media. Distribution however continues to be the power behind the throne. In 2010 we saw the emergence of application-based media as a distribution force to be reckoned with. While the first generation of iPad magazine apps have been just that, first generation, applications by companies like <a href="http://www.flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>,<a href="http://treesaver.net/"> Treesaver</a> and <a href="http://www.theflud.com/">Flud</a> show the power and potential of content applications and the role they will play in media.

<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><em>Marketing. <span style="font-weight: normal;"> <span style="font-style: normal;">2010 will be remembered as the year marketing regained its equilibrium. After a decade of turbulence brought on by the Internet; marketing, like media, realized that digital media is friend not foe. Lead gen myopia has evolved into branded response. We've gone from Mad Men to Math Men as marketers started harnessing the power of technology and analytics, combined with content-rich creative and created compelling, engaging, online-marketing. As noted in the post earlier this year:<a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/?s=advertising+isn%27t+dead"> Advertising Isn't Dead. It's Becoming Marketing. Again</a>. </span></span></em></strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><em>Technology. </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">2010 saw a series of game changing new technologies introduced. None bigger than the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>. So much has been written about the impact of the iPad that you could argue it's become over-hyped. Having seen a ton of technology innovations over the last 20 years I can tell you that the iPad has been under-hyped. Significantly. Like the Macintosh and the iPod before it, the iPad has launched a new category and created a vibrant ecosystem. The iPad is the missing link between the web and physical media. And we are only on the first generation.</span></strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><em>2011. </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">I'll leave the predictions to the economists and the futurists. Here are a few things I'll be watching however that I think will have an impact in 2011 and beyond:</span></strong></span></span>
<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Social Technology. </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Social platforms have changed the way we connect and communicate with friends and family. They will now change the way we connect and communicate in our work, with our governments and our educational institutions. Facebook may well be remembered as the company that ushered in the social web but the implications of social technology will be felt well beyond even its broad reach.</span></strong></li>
	<li><strong><em>Mobile. </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">The advances in mobile technology over the last several years have been breathtaking. The user experience of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#utm_campaign=us">Android</a> today is extraordinary. And getting better. From <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-mobile/download/iphone-for-skype/">Skype</a> over an iPhone to applications like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8">Word Lens</a> that converts English words to Spanish via a cell phone camera; smart phones today have made Science Fiction dreams a reality. Stay tuned. Your credit card is next.</span></strong></li>
	<li><strong><em>Information Design. </em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Let's be frank. The average web site is not great at showcasing information in ways that engage and inspire audiences. Most sites look like cars at a NASCAR race, with logos, icons, badges and any number of flashing bits of content and advertising. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> is a game changer however and is ushering in a new era in information design that will enable the creation of visually engaging content on the web. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
The intersection of Media and Technology is an incredible neighborhood to live and work in and I'm blessed to be a part of this dynamic industry. Regardless of what new innovations we will see in 2011 and beyond, the future is very bright indeed for Media, Marketing and Technology. Here's wishing you a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year.

				<![CDATA[<div>The shift from Eric Schmidt to Larry Page as CEO of Google is more than simply a change of leadership. It represents the broader shift in the center of gravity of the web from search to social. The surprising announcement in the change at the top of Google this week has created all sorts of conjecture. Google feels the heat from Facebook and needs to reignite the passion and focus. Google has become like Microsoft a large monolithic company that still generates considerable revenues and profits but where vision, innovation and passion have died. The Microsoft comparison is the most interesting one. You could make the argument that Bill Gates stepped down as head of Microsoft as the PC lost it's power as the center of gravity in computing. The dominant company in computing for the previous decade, Microsoft's business and culture started to change as the web became the computational platform. No longer the straw that stirred the drink Microsoft saw an entire generation of talent either retire to pursue philanthropic or personal interests, or leave to start their own companies or join new ventures. As with Bill Gates and Microsoft you also have the dynamic of mega-wealth in the change at Google; where a still active, capable CEO in Eric Schmidt may have interest in what he can do for the broader world and how he might use his wealth and position to have a positive impact on society.</div>
<div>Great brands and companies evolve. Google, like Microsoft, will go through market changes and leadership changes and if the core of the company and it's culture are as strong as we think, it will not only survive it will thrive. In 1997, there was a similar market shift and Steve Jobs came back to Apple as CEO. A friend who worked on Wall Street asked me if I thought Apple Stock was a good buy. I told him I would wait and see. A $1,000.00 investment in Apple stock at that point would be worth $1,000,000 today. It will be fascinating to watch Larry Page take center stage at Google and lead the next phase of the growth for the company. The shift from search to social has clearly created new challenges for Google but as with all transitions will also create new opportunities. One prediction is for certain, the battle for supremacy in technology is only going to get more interesting and the real winners will be the users of the extraordinary new applications and tools that will be the result.</div>]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great post Tony,

It will be interesting to say the least to see how Google and other search engines adjust to the shift to social.  Just like cycles in other industries, so long as a particular player survives the long haul, an entity may be a leader, then fall out of favor for a while only to return to dominate again. 

New games are being invented every day for all players (including new ones presently unknown) to meet the ever changing and rather challenging business environment.  And as you stated, the ones who utilize the new and spectacular tools will proceed quite nicely to the top of their niche. 

I am not quite sure how John Q. Public will adapt to the shift to social for their basic needs however, although I may be missing your point as I proceed with this thought.  Regarding jonny Q, we have just recently put our yellow page books down for good and moved them to doorstop status.  But to find our favorite restaurant and pool service company, we might be asking our compadres on Facebook for aid, but I am not sure quite yet.  I realize FB could become a major marketing tool (well already is), but if their biz model lets too many personal items out for marketers to see, they will be forced backward as they adjust to privacy issues.  Or the public will just learn how to hide from the marketers via a work around in the privacy settings on FB.  At any rate, I feel our recent adjustment from yellow pages to search has still a ways to go to fully mature, especially when we ad mobile search into that mix.  The intelligencia such as yourself and Google may feel differently because of just that, massive intelligence.  I am merely making the point that things might be shifting a tad fast for us our here in the real world to adapt right alongside the industrial shifts.   

This leads me to say as for marketers, Google and all other search engines do a great job of telling us what they want for main keywords and LSI keywords.  The Google Wonder Wheel and the Google keyword tool everyone uses are as good as it gets when it comes to succeeding at SEM.  Social being one of many great and interesting ways to integrate into a marketing plan (along with all manner of search including feeds, pings, directories, etc etc) makes me think that indeed, all roads DO lead to Rome, social being a huge factor no question. What a great time to be alive eh? 

Nice talking to you Tony!!]]></wp:comment_content>

				Rupe Was Robbed. Tales From The Front Lines of the iPad App Economy		</title>

				<![CDATA[If you were launching a daily newspaper today $30m would not be an outrageous sum of money to be spending. What would be outrageous is that you were launching a daily news<strong><em>PAPER</em></strong>. Spending $30m to create an iPad newspaper application is ludicrous. With substantial fanfare, Rupert Murdoch recently launched <a href="http://www.thedaily.com/">The Daily</a> an iPad and tablet based newspaper. He has also spent a ton of dough, a reported $30m and counting. Heck even with the house ad rates a sister division at <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corp</a> might enjoy, the Super Bowl ads had to run some $5m. Frankly they were kinda weak too....but I digress.  Simply put Rupe was robbed. While clearly a true media visionary and uniquely successful businessman, Rupert Murdoch's approach to the iPad and application based media revolution reflects an old media approach to what is now a new and very different media world.

The Application Economy is being driven by the fusion of information design and mobility. At the risk of alienating my open source and Android pals, the core manifestation of this is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad</a>. What is unique about the Application Economy is that from it's inception it was designed and built on an ongoing service business model. In other words you download or buy an application and part of the value is that the application will be updated on an ongoing basis. In developing applications you need to consider that user engagement and interaction dictate how you evolve and update the application. While perhaps a simple concept, this is still a huge cultural shift for broadcast media companies like News Corp. They are used to the "build it and they will come" methodology, where you pour huge money into a launch, creating a massive barrier to entry and hope to realize a profitable return years down the road. Movies, daily newspapers and television make up the vast majority of revenues and profits of News Corp so this approach has served them well. The application economy operates very differently however and requires the ability to manage an Application as a Service.

Will Rupe realize a return on his investment? Hard to say. I certainly wouldn't bet against him or News Corp. His first foray with the iPad however would indicate that he doesn't yet understand the model and still thinks massive investments will create audience value and a competitive barrier to entry.  No matter what your point of view the build out of the iPad App Economy will be exciting and fascinating to watch play out.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Has Charlie Taken the Sheen Off of Twitter?		</title>

				<![CDATA[Charlie Sheen has become a one man, always on, global media platform. From television to radio to newspapers and magazines to online, Sheen has become a constant presence in the media. Are we watching the mental breakdown of a talented actor before our eyes? Or are we witnessing a clever self promoter set himself up for his next entertainment venture?  Either way, what is indisputable is the fact that Sheen's media mayhem has been fueled by social media:
<ul>
	<li>Sheen drove over <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42010882">1million twitter followers in 25 hours</a></li>
	<li>Sheen outpaced Apple's new iPad, Lady Gaga, President Obama and Sarah Palin in <a href="http://www.eurasiareview.com/life-and-style/ethics-and-social/charlie-sheen-tops-obama-lady-gaga-and-the-ipad2-10032011/">social media ranking over the last 3 months</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/03/10/2011-03-10_charlie_sheen_looking_for_social_media_intern_applicants_without_tigerblood_need.html">74,000 people applied</a> to be Sheen's social media intern, within 48 hours</li>
</ul>
#winning, #tigerblood indeed. So what do Sheen's numbers teach us about social media platforms like Twitter?  Some are suggesting that Sheen has shown Twitter has more in common with traditional news media than initially thought. Anything to drive more viewers and the<a href="http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/7233-charlie-sheen-twitter-and-the-truth-about-social-media"> more sensational the better. </a> Given that Sheen is also working with the celebrity endorsement social media company, <a href="http://ad.ly/">Ad.Ly </a> some argue that Sheen is demonstrating the revenue potential of Twitter as a marketing platform. There is clear evidence that Twitter has benefited from their association with Sheen. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42010882"> CNBC estimates </a>that Sheen's impact has increased the value of Twitter by over 30%.

Regardless of what you think of Charlie Sheen or his antics, the impact of social media in his crusade is amazing. He built a large owned audience, in real time, in scale, with a self-published unedited narrative. My sense is that like the <a href="http://www.super70s.com/super70s/culture/fads/pet_rocks.asp">Pet Rock</a> "Charlie the media platform" will have a short shelf life. A friend of mine suggested that the sure sign that Charlie has jumped the shark is <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/charlie_sheen_negotiating_with_billionaire_2o1ehXSJoh61qsVMVhgiIN">interest from Mark Cuban</a> in creating a show with him. Perhaps the circus will move on but the impact of social media will continue.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Running Media		</title>

				<![CDATA[This month marks my 10th anniversary as a runner. In March of 2001 while walking around a mall in New York with my family I wandered into a running store. On a whim I bought a pair of running shoes. At the time I played tennis regularly and was reasonably active. I had bad knees from basketball though and had never thought they would hold up to distance running. For some reason I decided I'd like to give running a try. That first day I laced up my shoes and took off for a jog around our neighborhood. I ran for a total of 20 minutes. 10 minutes out, a brief rest and 10 minutes back. I measured the distance later with my car and I had covered 1.2 miles. Since then I've run over 7,950 miles. Yes, I've counted them. First in running journals and then via digital watches and running logs. I've tracked a few other stats along the way too:
<ul>
	<li>I've run in 7 countries</li>
	<li>15 states</li>
	<li>Through 27 pairs of running shoes, 6 running watches and countless t-shirts and shorts</li>
	<li>Run in 36, 5K races (3.1 miles)</li>
	<li>The best 5k time I've run is 23:23 (never said I was fast!)</li>
</ul>
I've run in 20', snowy weather and 100' desert heat. I've run through hills in Northern England and trails in the middle of Oregon. I've run on a treadmill in a hotel in Mumbai, India and along the beaches of Maui, Hawaii. I've run in a park in Dublin, Ireland and around an artificial river in Las Vegas, Nevada. 3 years ago on my birthday I ran 5 miles in Beijing, China in the morning, flew to Los Angeles crossing the dateline and ran another 5 miles on the same day. Then slept for 18 hours!

So right about now you're wondering what running has to do with Media, right? Well in taking time to reflect on 10 years of running I realized that I do a fair amount of thinking about media while running. At some level, I've thought about most every significant media trend, strategy, decision, creative idea, competitive step, presentation, speech or organizational move I've made in the last 10 years while running. It also hit me that this 10 year period happened to be one of the most transformative periods in the history of the media industry. Running media indeed.

Today on a 4 mile run along the coast on a beautiful day in Los Angeles, I couldn't help but reflect on the changes in media over the last 10 years. While the Internet is still a disruptive force, many media companies have harnessed it's power and built sizable web based businesses. New advances in social, mobile, location based technology and information design are opening up new avenues for media as well. And we are seeing a natural integration of media as audiences combine on and off line information and interests. I can't wait to see what the next 10 years will bring. See you on the road.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[<div>Last summer I wrote a post called <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2010/08/the-wonderwall/">"The Wonder Wall" </a> where I mused about the future of pay walls for content sites. Since then <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/28/technology/nytimes_paywall/index.htm">The New York Times</a> and other sites have launched pay walls  to great fan fare. How are they doing?  It's tough to tell given the scarcity of public numbers on pay wall revenues.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/07/new-york-times-paywall-co_n_846324.html">Posts and analysis from insiders</a> suggest that the NY Times spent a robust $25 Million creating their pay wall.  I think it may be a good long while before they see a return on this investment.</div>
Some sites with pay walls have seen their <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/11/new-york-times-paywall-stats/">audiences shrink</a> as readers previously able to access advertising supported content for free, now balk at being asked to pay. Less page views means less ad revenue, which puts even more pressure on the pay wall. "The good news is we generated paid subscriptions! The bad news is our traffic dropped and so did our ad revenue...". Wonder Wall indeed.
<div>One of the things people pay for when buying a newspaper or magazine, is the functionality. In the case of web based content however, readers have already paid for the functionality. Their computer provides that. So readers now have to determine whether in addition to the cost of a computer and online access, the cost of content is worth it. In the case of online newspapers and magazines, so far they seem to feel it's not. In my mind the question isn't whether web audiences will pay for online content. The real question is will online audiences pay for newspaper and magazine content with increased functionality?</div>
The iPad, iPhone, Droid and the application marketplaces demonstrate that people <strong><em>will</em></strong> pay for content with increased <strong><em>functionality</em></strong>. And the genius of the recurring revenue marketplace model of Apple becomes more and more impressive every day. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20031967-261.html">Apple has announced</a> their newspaper, magazine and book publishing marketplace strategy and given the initial steep 30% share, early <a href="http://newsonomics.com/9-questions-on-apples-itunes-for-news/">publisher reaction was mixed</a>. My sense is that even with the revenue split concerns, this model will become scalable and attractive to newspaper and magazine brands. Especially once they start to feel the pinch from cutting their audiences in half by instituting pay walls.

Let me know your thoughts. Are you seeing pay wall strategies that work? As a reader are you paying for online access to daily newspapers and magazines and if so which ones?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Content Wants to Be Created. Not Farmed		</title>

				<![CDATA[<div>

There's been a ton of debate over the value, or lack thereof, of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm">"content farms"</a>. The company <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-curation-may-spell-the-end-of-search-algorithms-2011-1">Demand Media</a> has served as a lightning rod in the debate drawing both ire and praise from media pundits and investors. If you're not familiar with Demand Media and other content farm operations, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_06/b4214064466703.htm">the model</a> is based on generating cheap content and stressing optimization to drive search results. The approach requires a large amount of traffic, generates questionable audience loyalty and demographics and obviously lives and dies based on the ability to consistently game out search engines.

Huffington Post and other <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-aol-way">AOL sites are in the discussion</a> too, as some people see them as nothing more than dressed up content farms. It's a fascinating debate. At the core of it is the value of content; to audiences, to media companies and to search engines.
<div>Content is a value game. Always has been, always will be. I'm not attempting to take some intellectual high ground here, nor ignore the obvious power and value of search equity. Regardless of the genre, sustainably successful content becomes so based on delivering high value to audiences. No matter how savvy your SEO specialists. The content farms I've studied are generating very low value content and over working search algorithms to generate high value search rankings. As more and more people turn to content that their friends, family, colleagues, trusted sources and leading brands guide them to, rather than "searching" the web, I think content farms may be hit by a drought.</div>
So you tell me. Am I being too much of a purest here? Is the future about farming content or creating it?

That might mean picking an industry that's not as competitive, or thinking about how you can become the host to a community.]]></wp:comment_content>

				From Chasing Customers to Creating Customers		</title>

				<![CDATA[The last several years lead generation has been the driving force in online marketing. From basic click-through to registration based programs, the majority of web marketing has simply been direct marketing. We are starting to see online marketing shift into a new phase however. A shift that combines the efficiency of direct marketing with the power of brand preference marketing. This shift is being driven by several factors:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Lost Brand Identity</strong>. By focusing almost exclusively on lead generation it's clear some companies have lost the power of brand. The decline of brand clarity and preference, takes away one the biggest advantages major brands have. Take a look at the recent market share drop at Pepsi as an example. The lack of brand awareness for newer or smaller brands makes it very difficult to stand out, gain traction and ultimately revenue growth and profits.</li>
	<li><strong>Content Has Become Advertising.</strong> Marketers are developing content based marketing that contextually resonates with customers and prospects. This type of branded response marketing creates a strong two-way dialogue that can be sustained and adjusted as brand, customer and market dynamics change.</li>
	<li><strong>Brand Scales.</strong> An unbranded lead is just that, unbranded. And like generic brands and goods they have limited value. A branded lead however, scales. It's like an introduction by a mutual, trusted friend versus a cold call to a prospect who has never heard of you.</li>
	<li><strong>Installed Base Matters.</strong> People and organizations who have purchased in the past are the best prospects for future purchasing. This is most acutely true in business marketplaces like technology. The companies that buy the most technology are the ones that have already made a commitment to technology. Facebook wasn't a great prospect for expensive servers when it was an early stage company. Once they had a good sized installed base however, they became a very good prospect and now buy 1,500 servers a month on average. When dealing with an installed base customer, brand and the roadmap behind that brand matters. A lot.</li>
</ol>
The fusion of direct and brand marketing is enabling companies to shift from chasing customers to creating customers. Brand marketing and demand generation are being redefined in this new phase of online marketing. Perhaps this shift is a sign that online is maturing as a medium. Or perhaps we as marketers are.]]>		</content:encoded>

				LinkedIn. A Little Bubbly? 		</title>

				<![CDATA[The LinkedIn IPO has generated a ton of debate in Internet, investing, technology and media circles. Some like stock analyst Jim Cramer think the nearly $8B + valuation is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cramer-linkedin-lnkd-2011-5">"ridiculous" and "outrageous"</a>, and potentially a sign of another "Internet Bubble". Others like business writer and former analyst Henry Blodget think the rapid rise in LinkedIn's stock price is an example of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/linked-in-ipo-2011-5-b">wildly under-valued initial pricing</a> by the bankers. These debates are what make markets. As someone who focuses on creating value in business as opposed to defining and setting value I'm not sure I can really add to the debate on whether the LinkedIn valuation is high or low. As is often the case, righteous is likely somewhere in between and ultimately the market will determine the level. I do think there are some things we can learn from the buzz and energy around the LinkedIn IPO however that are worth reflecting on:
<ol>
	<li><strong>The Shift from Search to Social.</strong> The astounding growth of both LinkedIn and Facebook reflect a profound and significant shift in web behavior and traffic. This shift can best be described as the shift from search to social. People today are far more interested in what their friends, family colleagues and peers are doing, thinking, reading and talking about, than they are in "searching" the web. We think this is also driving a return to brand as more and more web users turn or return to brands they know, trust and enjoy, as opposed to searching for information that yields increasingly poor quality and or conflicting search results.</li>
	<li><strong>LinkedIn is a Media Business. </strong><a href="http://www.internetevolution.com/author.asp?section_id=466&amp;doc_id=206730&amp;">A review of LinkedIn's numbers shows revenue's of $243.1M for 2010</a>. They have 3 categories of revenue: Hiring Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions. Hiring Solutions is their largest revenue category but they are clearly growing quickly in marketing solutions. LinkedIn has become both a platform for engagement for other media companies to leverage as well as a competitor. This type of "co-opetition" is not new in technology. It is still somewhat nascent in media however and something that the media industry is going to need to understand and ultimately harness and leverage.</li>
	<li><strong>This Isn't an Internet Bubble.</strong> The LinkedIn IPO will be remembered as a seminal event that perhaps ushered in the next phase of the Internet economy. The largest Internet IPO since Google, LinkedIn has clearly received a tremendous amount of interest. An analysis of their current numbers would suggest that this interest is based on future potential as opposed to current revenues and profits. That being said, LinkedIn is not an example of a "build it and revenues will come" approach. Nor are<a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/02/facebooks-valuation-100-billion/"> Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-17/groupon-is-said-to-discuss-ipo-valuation-of-up-to-25-billion.html">Groupon</a> examples of non-revenue based business models. Web 2.0 is simply the acknowledgement that the web is the computational platform. As a result we are seeing companies that are building scalable and sustainable businesses online.<em><strong> </strong><span style="font-style: normal;">We are now seeing a large number of B2B online media businesses that are growing <strong><em>and</em></strong> scaling. At the risk of sounding overly promotional our own <a href="http://www.ubmtechweb.com/">UBM TechWeb</a> chief amongst them.</span></em></li>
	<li><strong>What Does the LinkedIn IPO Mean for B2B Media? </strong> Forbes this morning ran a post titled: <a href="http://a.sw.io/GXkUCjI">"With linkedIn IPO, B2B Marketing Gets the Spotlight"</a>. The writer Russell Glass suggested that the LinkedIn IPO "...makes B2B...well sexy. Yea I said it sexy!". Couldn't have said it better myself. The LinkedIn IPO validates the power of B2B markets and marketing. The Internet economy is alive and well in business to business media. And the companies who have transformed their culture and infrastructure to become digitally centric, regardless of the platforms they work in, will be the beneficiaries.</li>
</ol>
Let me know your thoughts. How do you view LinkedIn's IPO and what impact do you think it will have on B2B media and marketing?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Don’t Trust This Blog Post (And How to Write Posts that Can Be Trusted)		</title>

				<![CDATA[The first thing you should know when you read this blog post is that you may not want to trust it.

I used to be a journalist—the very first online reporter for Tony’s <a title="InformationWeek" href="http://www.informationweek.com">InformationWeek</a>, in fact—and now I edit the <a title="Yahoo! Advertising Blog" href="http://www.yadvertisingblog.com">Yahoo! Advertising Blog</a>. I’ve had plenty of time to think about the differences between journalism and <a href="http://www.webinknow.com/2010/03/brand-journalism-.html">brand journalism</a>, another term for corporate blogging.

And I think that brand journalism is... well, not journalism in any form. That term needs to banished. But no matter what it is or what it’s called, it can still bring its readers content that matters. It can also help turn readers into customers, which is why marketers should get it right.
<h3>Bias? It ain’t so bad</h3>
Journalism, in my rosy view of journalism, depends on the ability to report facts as objectively as possible despite the biases of the reporter.  Bloggers, on the other hands, wear their biases on their sleeves. And that’s OK—if readers know what the biases are and can embrace them, they’ll find stuff that’s worth their while.

On my blog, for instance, you’ll find lots of great advice for advertisers (so says my bias), some plugs for Yahoo!, and not very many plugs at all for our competitors. You also won’t see many <em>digs</em> at our competitors because it’s bad PR and it’s just the way I was raised.
<h3>How to win trust</h3>
If you want to give people a shot at looking past your bias to the content beneath, you have to find ways to build their trust. The ways I do that are borrowed, not surprisingly, from journalism.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Tell the truth</strong>. *Sigh* I shouldn’t really have to spell this out, should I? Don’t lie. Don’t even spin. If you can’t figure out how to say something without making yourself look bad, just don’t say anything.</li>
	<li><strong>Be suspicious of adjectives.</strong> I’ve banned adjectives like “innovative,” market-leading,” and “world-class” from my team’s communications. They don’t mean anything and, honestly, what else would people expect you to say about your own products? I make my writers show me why we’re innovative, not just say that we are. You have to earn your adjectives.</li>
	<li><strong>Do some reporting.</strong> Just because you bought the megaphone doesn’t mean you can shout out anything you want. If you’re trying to make a controversial point (Like my <a href="http://www.yadvertisingblog.com/blog/2010/11/19/is-twitter-social/">look at Twitter as a marketing tool</a>), do some research, interview experts, and try to show a counterpoint.  (I’m not offering a counterpoint because I hope this is common sense.)<strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Be useful.</strong> My goal with our blog is to have 25% of the stuff about Yahoo!, and 75% of it content that helps our advertisers do their jobs. Does talking about something other than yourself make you more trusted? I think so. But it certainly makes you less boring.</li>
</ol>]]>		</content:encoded>

				Have you ever sold your home?		</title>

				<![CDATA[Have you ever sold your home?  One you’ve lived in for a while and has all the comforts of home?  If you’re like me, you imagine how potential buyers are going to admire the kitchen, the yard, even little things like the switch plate covers.  You hire a broker, get your home listed on <a href="http://www.realtor.com/">www.realtor.com</a> or wherever, put the cinnamon apple in the oven, and hold an open house.  You’re ready to wow them!

And, every gawker has a subtlety—or completely--different view of the very same house.  What they love or hate, what they’d keep or change.  If you could see a mind-video of how each person imagined your home, it would be a disorienting experience.  And someone steps up and pays the highest price and creates their own dream house.

Have you ever sold your company?  The one you’ve honed to top performance, with every competitive edge?  We went through this process last summer with Canon Communications.  The buyer, United Business Media, saw an opportunity for continued growth, but from a very different perspective, and they’ve remodeled the company to address that opportunity.

So, now I’m one of those gawkers scouring the listings, knocking on doors, imagining my “dream company”. And in this period of rapid change, finding the most appealing features of a company isn’t the way it used to be.  Imagine looking at a home during a period of rapid global warming—a waterfront property may be much less appealing than a house a mile inland!  Those wood-burning-fireplaces may be worth avoiding!

I’d like to keep you posted on my progress.  Unlike homes for sale, the process of selling a company is often kept highly confidential, so I’ll have to keep pretty non-specific and talk at a fairly strategic level.  But, maybe that will make the discussion more fun…]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Charles -

You've hit the nail on the head.  Unfortunately, the merger and acquisition market is not nearly as neat and tidy as the market for purchasing homes.  There is no MLS for owners who want to sell a business, and therefore, no neat list of companies with standardized listing criteria for people who want to buy a business.  Add to that the fact that most of the time there is no standard formula for business valuation, and what you have is a very inefficient and fragmented market.

Skilled merger and acquisition professionals can be a great help.  There are many who will assist you in looking for a business to buy, either for a minimal charge, or even on a success fee only basis.

				Love Is Good Business		</title>

				<![CDATA[The emotion of love is considered to be out of place or simply inappropriate in business—especially in the technology world. Many believe that good business people keep their hearts out of their work. But, it’s the heart that brings the fire of creativity to bear on the day-to-day. It’s the heart that inspires drive, loyalty and leaps of innovative brilliance.

I’ve done a lot of work with engineers, scientists and technologist over the years, so I’m well aware of the left-brain stereotype: “I’m an engineer; I don’t do that people thing. Keep the people out of the way so I can get my job done around here.”

But that’s all it is: a stereotype.

After listening to me speak about The Radical Leap (cultivate Love, generate Energy, inspire Audacity, and provide Proof), a network specialist emailed me to chime in on the LOVE thing.

“I’ve been a manager for 10 years,” he said. “And what you said about Love being a critical part of business is right on.

“I’ve told my technicians to make the customer absolutely love you.  Take-you-home-to-dinner love you.  Meet-the-wife-and-kids love you.  Because if the customer loves you, you can blow up their building and they’ll say ‘accidents happen.’”

We should all know by now that customer satisfaction doesn’t cut it any more. Nowadays, our customers have to love doing business with us—that’s where the loyalty, world-of-mouth, and retention comes from. (And the forgiveness factor, too, as our friend the network specialist is telling us.)

Striving to create an environment that people love working in will lead them to create products and services that customers love spending money on.

There’s nothing touchy-feely about that; it’s just damn good business.

What do you think? Does love play a part in the way you lead at your company?]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[My goal in launching Uphoff On Media 2 years ago was simple: experience  and learn social media and create a place where I could capture the  conversations I have with media, marketing and technology leaders. I  quickly learned a couple of things... First off, while I write regularly  as a part of my job,organizing thoughts in a 200-300 word blog post is  far more challenging than I had imagined. I gained a new level of  respect for my content colleagues.  Second, I learned what Mark Twain  really meant when he said  "If I had more time I would have written you a  shorter letter.” I found that blogging can ignite feedback and  commentary via a wide range of avenues. People commented back on blog  posts via email, FaceBook, IM, Text and in live meetings. I was giving  an interview about a year ago and the reporter asked a question  regarding "something you said about the media company of the future..." A  few minutes later it became clear that the reporter had read a blog  post of mine but not referenced it as such.

I want to take these conversations to the next level. With  this post, I welcome you to the new and expanded Uphoff On Media. Based  on feedback from colleagues, friends, family and the UOM audience, we  have enhanced the site, adding additional contributors, social media  functionality and a new design. Several friends of mine, who also happen  to be experts in their fields, have kindly agreed to participate.  Charlie McCurdy, CEO of Apprise Media; Jeff Klein, Founder of 101 Media,  ex-LA Times executive and currently professor at USC's Annenberg School;  Jeff Sweat, director of B2B marketing and social media for Yahoo!  and the editor-in-chief of the <a href="http://www.yadvertisingblog.com/">Yahoo! Advertising Blog</a>; and Steve  Farber, Author of the book "The LEAP" and former CEO of Tom Peters Inc,  will all be regular contributors. We will be adding additional voices  over the next few months as well.

Please let me know what you think of the new site. UOM is still  focused on the initial goal; experience and learn about social media and  create a place to capture discussions with thought leaders in media,  marketing and technology. The site remains a personal labor of love. We  look forward to your thoughts on topics and issues you'd like us to  cover and as always please feel free to join in.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Moments of Truth 		</title>

				<![CDATA[In the early 1980's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Carlzon" target="_blank">Jan Carlson</a> took over SAS airlines. The company was in poor shape and Carlson set  about to turn it around. He boiled the business down to a series of what  he called "moments of truth". These moments  were touch points where key interactions with customers or employees  took place. He defined being greeted at curb-side check in,  met and served by a ticket agent and the cleanliness of the airplane  as moments of truth, that were opportunities to either make or break the business. He went on to define similar moments with managers interactions with employees. I read his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moments-Truth-Jan-Carlzon/dp/0060915803" target="_blank">"Moments of Truth"</a> in the late 80's and it had a profound impact on me.

Moments  of truth can be hard to focus on during times of change like we've had  in the media industry over the last decade. The speed and metric based  nature of the Internet can also make it difficult to identify and  monitor the moments in your business. Perhaps this is why it's time to focus on the moments of truth in media now. A colleague of mine brought "Moments of Truth" up in a meeting recently and it got me to thinking about its applicability in today's media business.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Know the bell of truth when you hear it ring. </strong>We  are awash in data. Never before have we had so much data on our  audiences, our brands our products and our employees. After more than a  decade of a Wizard of Oz belief in search; generated by a  mysterious and all powerful algorithm that regularly changes and no one  understands, a socially reticent, Harvard dropout reminded us that it's  the connection with people that matters. The simple moment of truth  about the social layer is it allows people to connect with their  interests through people they respect, like and know. Dorothy taught us  this in 1936, exposing the Wizard of Oz for what he was. Easy for me to  note this now. I've gotten as caught up in gaming Google as anyone. The  reality is though SEO isn't a moment of truth. It's a powerful and  appropriate mechanism to assist with discoverability on the Internet.  Audiences are people and people are social beings however. Not data  points reflected by algorithms sitting on servers in the silicon  valley.</li>
	<li><strong>Spread Sheets and Deal Terms. </strong>The astounding level of metrics we can derive from the web can take on a life of it's own. From  CPC to CTR's to CPA and CPL the acronyms reflect a phase of deal term  and spread sheet selling. These metrics are important and demonstrate  the performance based value of online media.They do not replace however,  the need to understand a clients business, create proposals that  reflect this understanding and deliver marketing as a service that  assures marketers receive ongoing value. Again here this cannot be  automated. The moment of truth with your marketing customer does not  reside on a spread sheet. It is contained in your ability to understand  their business and create successful programs that will benefit their  marketing.</li>
	<li><strong>Presence Matters. Always. </strong>People cannot be inspired, led or  managed via email. Responses to surveys about employee attitudes or customer interests tell  you only so much. People respond to people. Leadership and management is  tough. It requires time, patience and emotional resilience. It also  requires presence. There is no greater moment of truth than when you  meet with customers or employees. It is this moment that is the  lifeblood of the media business. It is also the lifeblood of any  business.</li>
</ul>
What moments of truth do you see in your business? Are they changing? How do you track them?]]>		</content:encoded>

				Newspapers Dying: The Demise of Geographic Exclusivity 		</title>

				<![CDATA[There are so many reasons why print newspapers are failing.

Mostly, people complain that newspaper content is available on the Internet for free, so subscribers need not subscribe any longer, even though in reality circulation revenues were usually not more than 20% of total revenues. Or, more importantly, that classified advertising, the largest profit contributor of any newspaper, has been outdone by the efficiency of transactional web sites for homes, autos and jobs. Then there was the retail consolidation of big box stores, who hardly advertise, and chain department stores (only one advertiser rather than three or four).  And the many new alternative ways in which a local merchant can advertise--see <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.bogopod.com/" target="_blank">Bogopod</a>, to name a few. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Bogopod).  Still, what few realize is that most of the newspapers that have actually gone “belly up” have been afternoon papers or ones that were owned by overly leveraged companies.

But one of the underlying reasons of this massive change in newspaperdom doesn’t get enough attention: the demise of geographic exclusivity. In the good old days, when I was a newspaper executive at the Los Angeles Times, newspapers “owned” a market.  What did that mean?  It often meant we were “the only game in town” for both editorial content and advertising; which, in turn, meant, lots of cash flow and extraordinarily high profit margins. Newspapers are capital intensive entities. It takes a lot of cash to build a printing press, but once built, the barriers to entry for others were so very high, that you had a near geographic monopoly. Newspapers worried about competing in neighboring geographies, but not about someone from overseas or across the country invading their core territory.

So if you were a reader in Fresno, California, your only choice for local news was the McClatchy newspaper or the TV stations (which generally didn’t do a very good job on news other than car chases and crime).

And if you were a merchant in that same town, you had limited advertising choices, the newspaper which usually had the greatest reach, a TV or radio station, or perhaps direct mail. That was it. The newspaper “owned” the market.

The Internet ended geographic exclusivity.  Now you can get news from all over the world.  You don’t have to rely on the foreign correspondent of the Los Angeles Times stationed in Jerusalem or London, you can quickly find a more comprehensive take from the <a href="http://www.jpost.com/" target="_blank">Jerusalem Post</a> or the <a href="http://www.ft.com/home/uk" target="_blank">Financial Times</a>, and have it brought directly to you on your iPad by <a href="http://www.pulse.me/" target="_blank">Pulse</a>, <a href="http://flipboard.com/" target="_blank">Flipboard</a>, <a href="http://id.trove.com/identity/public/login/options" target="_blank">Trove</a>, or <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a>.

More important even than the readership problem, and, the real reason the local newspaper business model is dying is that advertisers from around the world can now reach you directly. They can advertise directly to you and deliver their product directly to you.  I still remember department store executives marveling at how powerful the Los Angeles Times was in this era, they could promote a sweater on the pages of the paper, and they would sell out of sweaters the next day.  The consumer had no other place to go. . . .to hear about the sweater, to see it or to buy it.  Now, the consumer can get to the sweater directly, on a multitude of web sites, use search to find it (and see advertising about it), see what other sweater owners think of it or even get a 10% off coupon by email.

Without geographic exclusivity, the newspaper business will never be the same.  Advertising will simply not return to its rich levels. Newspapers may survive, but in a very different form, with less information, less frequency, and less impact. The challenge, of course, is to figure out new business models to support the important journalism that newspapers provide. Well, that’s for future posts. Got any ideas?]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[That's a good perspective on the problem. If newspapers would embrace information marketing, they could thrive.

				Google+ : 5 Key Questions for Media and Marketing Pro&#039;s		</title>

				<![CDATA[Unless you've been living under a rock for the last week, you have likely heard all about Google's latest step into social networking, <a href="https://plus.google.com/up/start/?sw=1">Google+</a>. I received my invitation to test the Beta version last week and have spent some time with the platform. For Uphoff On Media readers who haven't yet received an invitation please send us your gmail address, via the comment feature, and we'd be happy to send you one.

It’s easy to dismiss the continual “new, new thing”  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle" target="_blank">hype-cycle</a> that comes out of the Silicon Valley.  But I think Google+ is worth paying attention to.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Hasn't Google Failed in Social Media Before?</strong> Well yes. By most every measure Google's steps in social media; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut">Okurt</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Buzz</a> as examples, have been failures. And there is certainly no guarantee that Google+ will be successful. From a standing start, looking up at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">Facebook's 750 million</a> active users is daunting. Google has a huge and powerful base of Google Search, Gmail and Google Doc users to build on though. This doesn't take Droid phone users into account either. Different than other Google attempts at social media, Google+ serves as a natural platform for other Google services and applications like mail and docs. They have also integrated chat, YouTube and video chat, via a feature called <a href="http://www.google.com/support/+/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=1257349&amp;rd=1">"Hangouts"</a>. (Have to say though, Newt Gingrich hosting the first political "Hangout" on Google+ was a buzz kill. But I digress...).The result is a dashboard like platform where users can smoothly move back and forth between search, mail, document management, chat and social networking. Oh yea, they can also optimize this experience through their own browser called <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/make/download-mac.html?brand=CHKZ">Chrome</a> too.</li>
	<li><strong>Does the World Really Need Another Social Network? </strong>Depends on who you ask. It also depends on what you mean by "social network". Given the extraordinary rise of Facebook and the relative cost of switching to another social network you would think that launching a competitive network would be foolish. On the other hand Facebook really has no direct competition and the level of world wide adoption of social networking would suggest that the market will support competitive offerings. When Google  was launched in 1999, there were <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2064954/Where-Are-They-Now-Search-Engines-Weve-Known-Loved">14 other search engines</a>, several with huge traffic and consolidation of the market had already started. Google is not a company intimidated by competition or what might seem to others as insurmountable barriers to entry. I also don't think they view Google+ as a social network. Their ambition is much larger. They see Google+ as the platform for search, social, email, video, document management and voice. A new operating system if you will, where social networking is simply a feature not a stand alone product.</li>
	<li><strong>Will Google+ Be a Traffic Driver?</strong> We have seen a clear shift from <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2011/01/22/search-to-social-to-schmidt-to-page/">Search to Social</a>. This shift has effected web behavior and traffic and make no mistake about it, the folks at Google have noticed. Anyone seen Eric Schmidt around lately?  The days of SEO and SEM being the <em><strong>only</strong></em> major drivers of building web traffic are waning and social media and applications are starting to surpass them. Before my SEO pals get all energized here, let me be clear...The need to assure that your content is discoverable via Search isn't going away. There is a new and powerful player in building web audience however and its Social. Arguably, Google+ provides the best of both worlds. Content that is posted via Google+ and content that is posted on the open web will be discoverable by search <em><strong>and</strong></em> social. Stay tuned however, Mark Zuckerberg and his pals at Facebook have been looking at this issue as well and what have been viewed as <a href="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2010/05/14/your-public-facebook-status-updates-now-publicly-searchable-outside-facebook/">private posts on Facebook</a> are increasingly accessible to the open web via search engines.</li>
	<li><strong>Is Google+ an Over-Reaction to Facebook? </strong>No. Google+ represents a significant pivot by a large company that realizes there has been a profound market transition and they need to make a move to continue to be a dominant player. My sense is that while Google is watching Facebook very carefully, as FB represents a significant threat to their core advertising business, their ambitions are far larger. Given the integration of Mail, Document Mgt, Messaging, Video and Voice into a dashboard like experience; Google is taking the next step in their enterprise ambitions. Is Google+ a Trojan Horse for the enterprise market? You could make that argument. If I were Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce.com, IBM and Jive Software I'd be paying close attention. And knowing these companies, I can assure you they are.</li>
	<li><strong>Who Wins in the Platform Battle Between, Google, Facebook and Others? </strong>Simply put, we all do. Markets always benefit by strong competition. We have already seen <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/social_network/231001098">Facebook make several announcements</a>, including the integration of Skype, in obvious and appropriate reaction to Google+. Apple, once a close partner to Google, dropped Eric Schmidt from the board and threatened a series of lawsuits around the launch of the Nexus 1 and Droid phones. The competition in wireless phones between Google and Apple has stimulated innovation in iPhone and Android OS phones alike. And the beneficiaries are the users. As Google and Facebook overtly push into the business marketplace we will see a new range of competitors take steps as well. The level of innovation we've seen in enterprise technology over the last 2 years; Enterprise 2.0 if you will, has exceeded the previous 10 years. I think the impact of nimble and innovative companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, who have traditionally been considered consumer technology companies, has been a major reason why.</li>
</ol>
I'm betting that Google+'s tight integration with email and search will make it a viable, lasting competitor to other social platforms. What do you think the impact will be for you as a media, marketing or technology pro? Drop me a note with your thoughts on how you see Google+ impacting the competitive landscape.

				<![CDATA["Assistant to the Chairman of the FCC on the Future of Media" is without question one of the coolest titles I've ever seen. Even cooler that it's the title of my friend and former colleague Steve Waldman. Steve and I worked together on the influential internet site <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/">Beliefnet</a>.  After 10 years with Beliefnet he recently joined the FCC as Senior Advisor to the Chairman, leading the future of media project.

In the announcement on Steve's new role, FCC  Chairman Julius Genachowski was quoted as saying:
<blockquote>A strong consensus has developed that we’re at a pivotal moment in the history of the media and communications, because of game-changing new technologies as well as the economic downturn...  At such a moment, it is important to ensure that our policies promote a vibrant media landscape that furthers long-standing goals of serving the information needs of communities. The initiative is intended to identify the best ideas for achieving those goal, while recognizing that government must be scrupulous in abiding by the First Amendment and never dictating or controlling the content of the news or other communications protected by the First Amendment.</blockquote>
I read one of the first pieces Steve did on the FCC's  <a href="http://reboot.fcc.gov/futureofmedia/blog?entryId=377886">"Future of Media"</a> project and frankly I was blown away.  I reached out to him to see if he would be interested in sharing his thoughts on the role of the FCC and the Future of Media project.  Here's what he had to say:
<blockquote>As we researched our Federal Communications Commission report – “<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/info-needs-communities" target="_blank">Information Needs of Communities: The Changing Media Landscape in a Broadband Age</a>”  -- we became convinced that much is misunderstood about the historical role of government in the development of media and communications.  Neither consistently libertarian nor socialistic, it has instead been a history of episodic interventions – sometimes visionary, sometimes parochial.  Some of these have made sense and some haven’t – and when we offered analysis and recommendations for our report, we tried to learn from that history.

For instance, the federal government has done well when it has focused on the development of communications infrastructure.  It managed the creation of broadcast, satellite and cable TV. Oh, and it financed the creation of the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-29-InternetMobile.pdf" target="_blank">Internet and the development of satellites</a>. Not bad. Government also does well when it establishes rules of fairness, to prevent abuse by certain market players and allow for continued innovation.

On the other hand, when it comes to the content of the media, the U.S. government is appropriately limited by the First Amendment.

We were presented with a dilemma. After year and a half of research, we found that the media landscape simultaneously has great bounty – tremendous innovation in nearly every crevice – and yet some serious deficits. We especially found a serious gap in local accountability reporting – the kind of journalism that helps prevent corruption in city hall, pollution in the local river or incompetence at the school board.  This is a <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-1-Newspapers.pdf" target="_blank">big problem</a> – one which the digital revolution had not yet solved.

Yet we also were extremely conscious of government’s limitations. As a result, in our <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-35-Recomendations.pdf" target="_blank">recommendations</a> we focused on a few areas:
<ul>
	<li>Universal broadband.  Since his first day in office as Chairman of the FCC, Julius Genachowski has made the achievement of universal broadband and the preservation of an open Internet his top priorities.  As part of this agenda, he has pushed to make more spectrum available for wireless broadband and to refuse the  Universal Service Fund to help subsidize the spread of high-speed Internet capacity.</li>
	<li>Though universal broadband was a crucial goal for Chairman Genachowski since day one, the Information Needs of Community report found another reason for these policies: they’re essential for helping media innovation to take root on the local level.  This is a matter of both equity and economics.  Communities suffer when newspapers contract. In some cases, new digital news operations have sprung up to fill the gaps but they are of no use to those who are not online.   Those people have the worst of both worlds.  It’s also a matter of economics.  If 100 percent of Americans gain access to the Internet, that will constitute a 50 percent increase in the number of people online.  That is bound to make it easier for local news entrepreneurs to create successful models.</li>
	<li>Government should become far more aggressive and open in putting data online.  This enables citizens to hold institutions accountable, creates opportunities for new information-based businesses and reduces the cost of journalism.</li>
	<li>The federal government spent $1 billion in advertising in 2005.  Why not have the feds <a href="http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/07/15/52564/tvb-pushing-to-move-fed-ad--to-local-tv" target="_blank">target that toward local news media</a> – “old media” and new, for-profit and nonprofit – to improve the cost-effectiveness of taxpayer spending and help local media?</li>
	<li>The tax code should be change to remove obstacles to nonprofit news innovation. The philanthropic world needed to increase its commitment to nonprofit media, especially of the sort that is not yet being taken care of by the commercial sector.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of many recommendations.  Suffice it to say, the nation is at a critical moment. I hope your readers will review this analysis and let us know what they think.  Here is an overview: <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/INoC-Executive_Summary.pdf" target="_blank">http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/<wbr>inc-report/INoC-Executive_<wbr>Summary.pdf</wbr></wbr></a>

And here is the full report: <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/inc-report/The_Information_Needs_of_Communities.pdf" target="_blank">http://transition.fcc.gov/osp/<wbr>inc-report/The_Information_<wbr>Needs_of_Communities.pdf</wbr></wbr></a></blockquote>
My thanks to Steve for taking the time to share his views with the Uphoff on Media community. Please let us know what you think about the role of the FCC and government in media's future.]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This was a very very interesting and insightful article, which has forced me to download the FCC Working Group "Information Needs of Communities." I believe the role the government needs to have a greater presence in these areas for the sole benefit of the community as well as for business.

I have always heard the hype on new technologies that would take over other older areas. For example the e-card I have not received on in over eight years but I still get a Birthday cards from friends and Family in the mail each year. I have heard since I was in college that we were on the cusp of a paperless society. Which still to this day I can not see this because of the need for legal documentation. The more electronic our society becomes the easier it is to alter documentation. For example a about six years ago I worked for a pharmaceutical company who was using a PDF format for their MSDS's as well as their procedures which they were signed and dated. Due to my advanced knowledge of the Adobe Creative Suite I had to demonstrate how these documents can be altered these documents to make them look almost exactly like the originals and showed them how I can get around password protected PDFs. 

Though I believe that change is the nature of things, movement through technology still needs to move slowly I am finding out that every update in the technology area lately has lacked in the area of R &amp; D. And example of this is the OS update on the MAC computers in June. They put out the update 10.6.8 for OS X but did not test it in the area of Network printing. This update rendering computers who printed over a network useless for a few days before there was a work around fix in place. This sent a very bad taste in the mouths of the advertising agencies because the quickest fix was to wipe the computers clean and reinstall all the software. In an industry of time is money like advertising if the update was done it was crippling. I think we should really look before we leap in all our decisions.]]></wp:comment_content>

				Value This!		</title>

				<![CDATA[In order to buy  a company you need to value it.    That’s not so easy in the media business, these days.

Lots of folks refer to multiples, of cash flow or revenue or whatever, as a way of determining future value.   You project the expected future performance of the company, factor in the cost of capital, and calculate a price.  Excel does this very well.

But any such formula for pricing a company relies on a degree of certainty about the nature and value of what the company does. At media industry conferences the overwhelming sense is one of uncertainty about this. Will print finally go away?  To what extent will search be supplanted by social?  Are apps replacing the browser?  Will virtual events supplant or enhance live events?  How media products are consumed and used has become entirely unpredictable.  There’s plenty of agitated debate, much of it legitimate, but none of it conclusive.  The only thing anyone can agree on is that the media business will have to continue to adapt.

So, how can you value a media business today?  Any valid projection of future value of a business requires you to make good assumptions about the shape of that business six months, a year, and five years from now.  That’s pretty hard to do in the media business.

While I’m not about to throw away the spreadsheet, I think any valuation of a media property these days needs rely on qualitative factors:
<ul>
	<li>What are the attributes of the market served?</li>
	<li>How deep are the relationships between the media company and the audiences/content consumers and suppliers/advertisers?</li>
	<li>How plugged-in and adaptable is the talent pool of the company?</li>
</ul>
I happen to believe that strong, innovative media companies will take advantage of this state of continual flux.  They will adapt and prosper. Weaker, more static, media companies will go away. Figuring out which is which can’t be done in Excel.]]>		</content:encoded>

				The Love Practicum		</title>

				<![CDATA[The idea that love is "just damn good business” (as I suggested in my <a title="Love Is Good Business" href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2011/06/20/love-is-good-business/">previous post</a>) is equally easy to embrace or dismiss, depending on your personal bias or point of view.

Assuming for a moment that you’re one who accepts the idea (and if you're not, consider this anyway—you may surprise yourself) how do you go about putting it into practice in your business? How do you take the idea (or ideal) of love-at-work and translate it into the ways that you and yours make things happen every day?

It's a huge challenge, but you can start by taking a lesson from superstar technical talent agency, <a href="http://www.kineticom.com/" target="_blank">Kineticom</a>. Love is not an idea for this $60 million dollar, award-winning, Inc. 500 company, it’s a practice that their employees are hired for and measured on.

Cultivating Love is not only one of Kineticom’s core values, it’s part of their performance evaluations, too (as well as the other practices of Extreme Leadership: Energy, Audacity and Proof). They've made Love a cultural expectation and, therefore, a day to day reality.

Pretend for a moment that you work at Kineticom, and it’s time for your evaluation. Here’s how you’d be sized up, love-wise (thanks to the Kineticom gang for their permission to share):

Their evaluation defines Cultivating Love like this:
<blockquote>Demonstrating love (of the future we’re working together to create) in the way they work with, serve, and lead the people around them. (Leadership includes peer level.) Love in this sense is a feeling of strong attachment induced by that which delights or commands admiration; preeminent kindness or devotion to another. At its core, being an Extreme Leader means doing what you love in the service of those who love what you do.</blockquote>
Their description of the lowest rating in the Love category:
<blockquote>Views daily actions and efforts as part of a job, not part of a broader future that employee has a key role in creating. Does not understand or connect personal or organizational opportunity to make a difference in the world.</blockquote>
And the highest rating:
<blockquote>Fully and actively embodies love in the way they work with, serve, and lead the people around them. Consistently cultivates love of the future we’re creating together in teammates, contractors and/or clients through tangible actions.</blockquote>
Sure, that may still sound a little subjective—maybe that’s the nature of the beast—but the implications are anything but: those who consistently rate high on this attribute (and the others) are given greater opportunities, more money and, potentially, stock in the company.

How do your measurements and performance standards stack up?

Try putting a little heart in there, and see if you can't make the experience of working with you a practicum in the Business Theory of Love.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Newspapers Clipped  By The Web		</title>

				<![CDATA[A newspaper was always so much more to its readers than a printed page full of news. It was the place that provided local, regional, national and international news. It was also at the center of your universe, your community. It was a breakfast routine. It was utilitarian as well as informational.

Unfortunately, everything that newspapers once provided is now available on the Internet in an efficient, immediate, and less expensive format. <em>Let’s review.</em>

Newspapers provided news and analysis, breaking news, opinion, arts and entertainment criticism. Now you can keep up to date with minute-by-minute breaking news with RSS Feeds, Google News, newspaper online news alerts, or the Huffington Post. Winner: The Internet.

We turned to the newspaper for shopping information. We could check the latest discount prices for tires, or learn when department store sales began. It was where we looked for a job or an apartment to rent. Now, we get daily deals from Groupon, roommates from Craigslist, and direct offers in emails from the few surviving department stores. Winner: The Internet.

Although journalists didn’t like to admit it, newspapers were a form of entertainment and education. We laughed while reading Dilbert and other comics. We chuckled at the advice from Ann Landers. And we improved our Bridge game with moves provided by the newspaper column. Now, we can find all of that and much more, including educational or entertaining You Tube videos, from an array of internet sites such as dilbert.com, astrology.com, even bridgedoctor.com. Plus we get to share with others who have similar interests. Winner: The Internet.

At least newspapers were full of helpful data: the closing stock prices, the starting times for movies, and obituaries. But Fandango will tell you what time the movie starts, what others think of it, and let you order a ticket. Who wants to see yesterday’s closing stock price when you can get up to the minute pricing from Bloomberg.com? And the Web even now has obituaries and death notices. Winner: The Internet.

But at least a newspaper provided the glue that kept a community engaged and together. You couldn’t start your day if you worked in the U.S. government or national politics without reading the <em>Washington Post</em>, and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> entertainment section was the “bible” for movie executives. But now people with shared interests turn to Facebook or LinkedIn to see what is “hot” in their industry. Winner: The Internet.

So it’s no wonder newspaper company stocks are no longer the darling of Wall Street. Newspapers made with ink and paper, delivered by trucks, will be around for some time, at least until the Baby Boomer generation dies off, but their profits and readership will continue to deteriorate.

In a recent <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-why-people-still-subscribe-to-newspapers-2011-8">Ad Age survey published on Silicon Alley Insider</a>, “local news” and “coupons” remain the two biggest reasons consumers subscribe to a local newspaper. So if you are a newspaper executive, you have to be paying a lot of attention to the future of Groupon, which may eventually replace newspaper coupons, and AOL’s Patch, which is trying to deliver local neighborhood news on over 500 community sites.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-996" title="Reasons for subscribing" src="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chart-of-the-day-reasons-for-subscribing-to-a-local-newspaper-august-2011.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" />

I’m just glad I don’t work for a newspaper company any more.]]>		</content:encoded>

				AOL, Tech Crunch and the Rules of the Game		</title>

				<![CDATA[The latest controversy between<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/business/media/michael-arringtons-audacious-venture.html" target="_blank"> AOL and Michael Arrington</a> is a fascinating story. Strong personalities with strong points of view, editorial ethics, management missteps, and big company culture versus small company passion make this a particularly juicy drama.

Arrington has made<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/the-end/" target="_blank"> an ultimatum to AOL</a>: Give us “editorial independence” or sell us the site back. By “editorial independence” Arrington means that Tech Crunch can continue writing about companies that he invests in via his<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2011/09/02/crunch-theater-bloggers-vc-fund-creates-media-spectacle/" target="_blank"> Crunch Fund</a>.  All of a sudden AOL has realized that this might possibly pose a conflict of interest.

Give me a break. When they bought Tech Crunch AOL was buying a page view engine, not quality journalism. Internal AOL memos show that the acquisition of Tech Crunch was all about content automation, not the content itself. Naming Arriana Huffington, the ultimate brandividual, as head of content demonstrates that AOL management thinks search rankings and posts per hour metrics suffice as editorial management. AOL itself was going to put money into Crunch Fund. And anyone who spends time in the Silicon Valley knows Michael Arrington's story; a clever journalist with an out-sized flare for the dramatic and an extraordinary talent for self promotion.

Let me know your thoughts. Did AOL not really understand what and who they were buying? Or are they genuinely concerned about quality journalism and editorial ethics?]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I suspect AOL is concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest and that that conflict will harm the long term viability and reputation of techcrunch. But thank you, Tony, for defining some terms here. "Independence" implies independence FROM something. Arrington claims that means independence from interference from AOL meddling in it's business and editorial policies. I imagine AOL claims it is independence from a journalistic conflict of interest. 

It sounds like Arrington wants to publish his content without accountability, and if I were AOL and the owner of Techcrunch, I would have a problem with that. If it comes down to looking at the issue from this angle and the two parties taking sides around these positions, Arrington will and should lose. 

However, I think this is all kind of a red herring. What's wrong with disclosing alleged conflicts of interest? If Arrington has an investment in a company being covered on Techcrunch, that can be stated in small letters at the bottom of any given article and readers can judge for themselves about the objectivity of the author and publisher. 

Having his hands in both jars, on the surface, may appear to be conflict. But it can also be a competitive advantage. On the journalistic side, you have access to insider and exclusive news no one else can get. On the investor side, you have access to a well respected, highly popular news outlet. that's what Arrington should be arguing.

Many argue that is a conflict of interest. But if you're able to manage both of these ventures with integrity, you will gain a reputation for being objective and be able to take advantage of the competitive advantage with little downside. The question is, does Arrington have or is he capable of achieving that reputation? ]]></wp:comment_content>

				Who Do You Trust? 10 Things to Consider About Vetting in the Age of Social Media		</title>

				<![CDATA[Fifteen minutes after the first Tweet stating that the US military had found and killed Osama Bin Laden, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer was struggling on air. Blitzer could only react to what he (and everyone else) was reading on Twitter. For an excruciating amount of time Blitzer repeatedly explained that they couldn’t verify the reports. At last he confirmed what everyone had known for 20 minutes, that indeed Bin Laden had been killed. Social media has changed how we get our news. Today it’s fair to say that Twitter breaks news and television covers it.

Social media however is just that. It’s social. While news organizations use social media, citizen “journalists” and “reporters” fill the vast majority of Twitter streams and Facebook posts. Is Jon Bon Jovi dead or alive? When did Joe Paterno die? What exactly did Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum say at the latest stop on the Republican presidential primary tour?

Vetting the accuracy of the information on social media is challenging to say the least. Company and personal brands can be enhanced and extended via social media. They can also be destroyed. We will be addressing these topics at our panel discussion at the SXSW Conference: “<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP9214">Vetting in the Age of Social Media. Who Do You Trust?</a>” If you’re at SXSW this year, please join us. In the interim here are 10 things to consider about vetting in the age of social:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Brand Matters</strong>. Ironically the rise of social media has driven a renewed interest in branded content. People and brands you can trust and that you rely on for your news and perspective. Regardless of the level of importance of the news, people want to trust their sources.</li>
	<li><strong>Know the Difference Between Gossip and News</strong>. The water cooler is digital today. Don’t overreact to fun, gossipy information that is passed around on social networks and hold it to the same standards as news.</li>
	<li><strong>Beware of False Prophets</strong>. In any gold rush there are legions of consultants and advisers that appear, providing expert analysis and advice on the trends shaping the market. Social media is rife with them. They will give you social media advice for a fee about developing trust, creating followers, curating content and generating “likes” and “recommendations”. Some of this advice can be valuable. Much of it is not.</li>
	<li><strong>Trust is built over time</strong> and erased in a moment in the digital world. The "trust wars" tend to take place in public with commenters taking sides.</li>
	<li><strong>Trust has become tiered</strong>. Do you trust the author, the brand and transparent relationships to the topic covered? All three need to be aligned and reinforce one another.</li>
	<li><strong>Brand to Brandividual</strong>. Trust can follow the trusted source and leave the brand behind</li>
	<li><strong>The Shift from Search to Social</strong>. What you read on the issue is increasingly built on following trusted links from social networks, not SEO based discovery.</li>
	<li><strong>Beware Anonymous</strong>. Automated and autonomous commenting on articles has been over-gamed to have little meaning.</li>
	<li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>. Writers have to work as hard at building social communities as they do at creating content. They need to engage the audience throughout the story's life.</li>
	<li><strong>The Role of Video</strong>. Video is emerging as the favored trusted source. You can see an interview taking place which is hard to fake as opposed to text which is fungible.</li>
</ol>
The impact of social media has been profound for journalists, media companies and consumers alike. How to leverage the extraordinary power of social media and at the same time vet the who, what, where, when and why continues to be a challenge however. Let me know your thoughts on vetting in the age of social.]]>		</content:encoded>

As it relates to breaking news, yes, Twitter as forever changed that model. And, with products like this becoming available - Twitter Tool Will Help Journalists Break News [VIDEO] http://on.mash.to/xCOYdl - it will certainly help Wolf when it comes to confirming sources, LOL. Brands do matter - but may matter less for millennials, who are 2x as likely to rely on UGC from friends or "like minded strangers" for product recommendations/purchase.  And YES - video is huge! (Funny how are kids new that 3 years ago, :) ]]></wp:comment_content>

				<![CDATA[I just made my first trip to SXSW. I'm not really a conference hound, even though conferences are a huge part of what we (<a href="http://www.ubmtechweb.com/" target="_blank">UBM TechWeb</a>) do. There are only 365 days in the year. On most of those days we’re producing an event somewhere, from industry-wide marathons like <a href="http://www.interop.com/" target="_blank">Interop</a>, <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/" target="_blank">Black Hat</a>, or <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" target="_blank">Game Developers Conference</a> to small roundtables on, say, green data centers or IPV6. It’s hard enough for me to keep up with our own big events, much less take the time to sample others.

But I was invited to participate in a panel and decided to spend a few days beforehand at SXSW figuring out the hype to reality ratio. Here’s what I found.

You remember when you studied basic physics in college and you learned that technically bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly? That's SXSW. It’s about everything -- tech, media, film, music, brand marketing -- and nothing in particular. It’s industry facing and consumer facing. It’s a conference, a trade show and spring break all rolled into one.

From a conference and event point of view it makes absolutely no sense. It should not fly, and in some ways it doesn’t. The content is choppy. The attendee experience is nightmarish at times.

But SXSW does fly. It flies because it gathers a huge number of smart, inspiring and entertaining people in one place and time to distribute and connect ideas. That’s always been the power of live media. It will always work, and it’s an ever more valuable thing in a fragmented media world.

Which brings me to Jay-Z, who had a concert on Monday night at Austin City Limits. Most likely that’s why he couldn’t make it to our panel on <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP9214" target="_blank">Who Do You Trust? Vetting in the Age Of Social</a> at 9:30 on Tuesday morning. But the room was chock full of other smart people, some of whom were listening to us with Jay-Z still in their heads.

Jack Halley, a journeyman NBA player and long time teammate of Michael Jordan, famously quipped "Michael and I went off for 57" while being interviewed after Michael's record breaking 55 points against the New York Knicks. At SXSW I found out how that feels to be Jack Halley -- it feels pretty darn good.

(I’ll share my thoughts on our panel later this week. In the meantime please let me know what you think of SXSW.)]]>		</content:encoded>

				What&#039;s Next?		</title>

				<![CDATA[For the last 6 years I have led a team that has transformed a declining print-centric business into a fast-growing $200 million digital media, live event and marketing services behemoth, otherwise known as UBM TechWeb. It has been an extraordinary experience and one that I'm immensely proud of. I've made the difficult decision that this is the right time for me to leave the company, refresh and evaluate my next venture. I will remain a loyal friend of UBM and retain a vested interest in the continued success of the people and the company. I know that my colleagues will take the strong foundation that we have built to even greater heights. I will be rooting them on as they do.

So what's next? Well, first I'm going to take some time off and reintroduce myself to my wife and family. Six years of intense work, living on airplanes and out of a suitcase, can make you feel like a stranger in your own home. It’s time to assure myself that my wife and daughter remember what I look like, and for me to remember what it's like to spend more than one week at a time in one place. The loss of both my father and father in-law in the last year has put a fine point on the value and power of family for me. I'm also going to dust off my surfboard and spend a little time in the water.

After a brief refresh I will be actively exploring my next great adventure. Here are the 6 market dynamics that I feel will shape what I do next:
<ol>
	<li><strong>The Intersection of Paid, Earned &amp; Owned Media:</strong> In their Marketing and Advertising Report 2012; Outsell projected that B2B marketers now spend $72 billion annually on their own direct-to-consumer digital marketing. Driving this shift is the focus on customer engagement and the opportunity to earn additional exposure from this engagement. A significant opportunity exists for applications, tools and services that enable marketers to integrate paid, earned &amp; owned media, simplify the process and drive performance.</li>
	<li><strong>The Transformation of Live Events Through Social, Local and Mobile Media:</strong> In an increasingly fragmented media world, the ultimate scarcity is bringing high demographic people together in one place at one time around common interests. We will see a deep integration of social, local and mobile technologies that will revolutionize live media and extend the live experience before, during and after events.</li>
	<li><strong>Digital Media &amp; Marketing:</strong> New technologies, tools and applications will continue to accelerate the transformation of the media and marketing industries. Tablets and other mobile devices are still at the early stage of their impact. We've only begun to see the potential of video and other visual platforms. The range of marketing automation, data analysis and other analytic tools coming out is staggering. We are at the nascent stages of what will ultimately become a massive industry.</li>
	<li><strong>The Return of Branded Content:</strong> People are far more interested in what their friends, family, colleagues and trusted members of their social graph are doing, reading, writing and viewing than in "searching" the web. Many web publishers, however, have focused so intently on optimizing for search engines that their sites look like cars at a NASCAR race. This creates an opportunity for a new generation of branded, content-rich sites and applications designed to build and serve ongoing communities, and provide new platforms for marketers.</li>
	<li><strong>Application-Based Media:</strong> Mobile apps have changed the way we think about content and online engagement. The ability to integrate audio, video, the social layer and other applications to enhance the user experience is incredible, and we are seeing new, innovative applications built every day -- including media that is embedded directly into work flow applications. These are shifts that will ultimately change the way we think about media itself.</li>
	<li><strong>The Return of Smart Money:</strong> In the early days of the web, venture firms introduced the idea of "Smart Money" — which includes access to management experience and other resources with the funding. Today’s lean start up movement has created a renewed demand for early-stage company structures that include access to Smart Money, driving tremendous opportunities for early-stage companies in media, marketing and technology.</li>
</ol>
There is no lack of opportunity in the market. As I explore these trends, I also hope to find a bit more time to write and discuss the market dynamics that are shaping the future of our industry, and I plan on expanding on some of these trends in future posts.

Let me know your thoughts on these trends and others you see. And drop me line about interesting opportunities you see in the marketplace.]]>		</content:encoded>

I just heard about this and was amazed. In my view you were the star at UBM, a true creative, entrepenurial, and a inspirational leader to your people. The barn door opened and the best horse just left. Hope to see or hear from you soon.

				5 Reasons Advertising is Dead (And What Smart Marketers Are Doing About It)		</title>

				<![CDATA[After a decline of over 11% in 2009, the US advertising industry grew at the anemic rate of 2.8% last year. Estimates for 2012 are in the same range. But with two major events that are historically drivers of high advertising spending -- a presidential election and the Olympics -- slated for 2012, the lack of projected growth raises significant questions.

Advertising as we've known it is dead. Here’s why:
<ol>
	<li> <strong>The focus on metrics:</strong> Online advertising picked apart the advertising revenues of daily newspapers -- from classifieds to daily specials to job listings -- piece by piece, until there wasn't anything left. The lure of measurable click rates and the promise of tangible ROI soon began to attract non-classified advertisers, too, and the fast slide had begun. The traditional advertising goal of creating awareness simply doesn't translate well once the expectation has been set that everything could be measured. "You can't manage it if you can't measure it. If it can't be measured it, it isn't worth doing" was not a slogan created by an ad agency.</li>
	<li><strong>The rise of “owned media:”</strong> The shift from paid to owned media has been dramatic: Outsell Inc projects that marketers will spend $72 billion on their own direct to consumer digital initiatives this year. Fifteen years ago, this money would have been spent on "advertising" paid media. Marketers have grown weary of searching for the elusive reach and frequency formulas that give them the right share of voice. They want to be the only voice.</li>
	<li><strong>Shifting the budgets to lead gen.</strong> Historically, advertising expenditures sat "above the line,” classified as an overhead expense, while spending on direct marketing and field sales sat "below the line," where it was viewed as being a direct sales expense. The Internet created a boom market in spending on lead generation activities, and allocating this expenditure is tricky. In many cases, lead generation activities are led by groups that sit next to marketing, but actually report into sales. Is it still advertising?</li>
	<li><strong>Content is the new marketing platform.</strong> Buyers are voracious consumers of information. For marketers, creating brand awareness, preference and affinity has become about providing the consumer with compelling, useful content. Company and product brands need to have an ongoing narrative with consumers that is true to the brand, and that creates and sustains engagement. Content is the new marketing platform.</li>
	<li><strong>The un-counted commercial minutes:</strong> Television abounds with examples of marketing expenditures that no longer count as advertising in the traditional sense. On American Idol, Ford hasn't increased the number of 15-30 second spots it runs on the program. The company has, however, created custom content, with the finalists all participating in a video where they sing, dance and interact with a Ford car. And the winner of the show gets a Ford automobile. These 90-second “spots” do not show up in the ad tracking stats -- but you can be certain Ford pays a premium for them.</li>
</ol>
<strong>If you’re tracking advertising industry stats, you’re tracking the wrong thing.</strong>

Advertising is dead. Marketing however is alive and well; even as it takes on a myriad of new forms, many of which are not easy to track.

Smart marketers no longer pay attention to "advertising growth rates." Instead, they’re measuring bottom-line metrics like customer engagement and prospect conversions, and using those numbers to drive their marketing investment.]]>		</content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lou, thanks for the comment here. Your point on advertising supporting a purchase is a good one. Marketing research released in the late 90's showed that the majority of auto advertising was to the installed base of purchasers to drive brand loyalty and the net purchase. I'd suggest however that they way to do this today isn't through traditional advertising but rather through content marketing, which may well be via the auto companies own content assets; sites, social feeds, video channels, etc. 

As for our understanding of media changing I'd argue that media itself has been irrevocably changed. The fundamental economic underpinnings of a large portion of the media industry  has been blown apart and fragmented into a range of web and digital models, few of which scale as of yet. The harsh reality for many media businesses today is that producing quality, engaging content and aggregating a high-deomgrahpic audience around that content, is no longer the sole bastion of traditional media. Frankly the one-way broadcast culture of most traditional media companies is a hinderance in unlocking the read-write, crowd-sourced nature of media today. 

All in all a compelling and fun debate. And a truly exciting time of opportunity as we watch and participate in the reinvention of media.

Best,
Tony]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Advertising is not necessarily dead, but it has morphed significantly.  What has died, very specifically, is the understanding of how media works.  We've had a one-way form of communication for the better part of a century with the audience force fed information in whatever way to communicators wanted it to go.  The audience now has more choice in how they consume information and the strength of their skepticism has grown with it.  Advertising no longer drives decision but is more of an affirmation of a decision already made.  It makes you feel good about your purchase and encourages you to do it again.  I drive a Chevy now but I have never once considered buying one because of a commercial.  Now, when I see commercials for my new car, which I am very happy with, I feel I made a really good choice.  The real value of advertising, now, is customer retention, not acquisition.]]></wp:comment_content>

				The Sorry State of Online Measurement: We&#039;re Still Honking at Billboards		</title>

				<![CDATA[Never has something so valuable been worth so little. Never in the history of media has a still new medium had the vast majority of its inventory valued at zero. Such is the state of online advertising. The latest click-through rates for online media sit at .09%. Given that click-through rates serve as the foundation for how the majority of online inventory is valued, this means that 15 years after the launch of the commercial Web, 99.91% of online inventory is worth nothing. Pricing online advertising inventory based on the number of people who click ads is the equivalent of pricing billboard's based on the number of cars who honk when they drive by. Literally.

So how the hell did we take one of-if not the-most valuable mediums ever created and set the value of the audience generated; other than their physical click-through reactions, as effectively worthless? More importantly is this it? The 100's of billions of impressions delivered online will only be valid if someone clicks, likes or in some way socially shares? Perhaps. But I don't think so.

The unprecedented power of search technology overwhelmed any other forms of measurement and the entire ecosystem of the first and second waves of the Internet were built around direct-marketing models. This created a massive disruption that destroyed many parts of general media and sent an entire generation of online media into the death spiral of gaming out search engines. Sites that look like cars at a NASCAR race, drive by traffic, ever increasing audience costs and sketchy demographics followed. As did the massive and in many cases devastating swings in audience based on Google's shifting algorithm…always given cute and unassuming names like Penguin :).

We are at a fascinating and crucial inflection point in the maturation of online media. Marketers are realizing that reach, demographics and engagement are all key and that many of the first generation metrics that defined value in online media simply aren't relevant today. There are also new measurement systems emerging that show promise at being able to blend the quantitative power of web with qualitative data that reflect interest, affinity and intent, providing a more holistic view of the value of specific online audiences. If you're running an online media business today however you cannot wait until these services become mainstream. You need to start investing in research that allows you to clearly define the reach, demographics and purchase interests and intentions of your audience. The current syndicated tools are too weak. Being able to differentiate your brand value via detailed demographic and psychographic profiles of the audience you generate is key.

Yes, I know some of the ad agencies won't easily accept proprietary research as it is challenging to fit the data into the quadrants they use for comparison. Being able to stand out and position the unique value of your brand is the key to your current and future success, however. Online media brands today will only scale if they can either:
<ul>
	<li>Truly harness a direct marketing metric like click-through's to make money, which requires massive amounts of traffic, or</li>
	<li>Differentiate their brand based on audience value and charge a commensurately valuable and profitable CPM.</li>
</ul>
Unless you can do the former you need a clear strategy for the latter. The problem is I see way too many online media businesses today stuck on the bridge between these two positions. In other words, hoping that more cars honk as they drive by their billboards.]]>		</content:encoded>

				Ignore the Analysts. 5 Reasons to Go Long on Facebook.		</title>

				<![CDATA[Historically I've not invested in individual stocks, particularly tech-related stocks. Given my background running technology media companies I've followed the policy that if you have responsibility for editorial operations, you don't trade in the stocks of companies your media brands cover. I've always analyzed the value of tech companies however: their market positioning, their product offering, their management strength and their ability to scale. Lately Facebook’s stock has taken a beating, but here are the top 5 reasons to be optimistic about the company’s future:<strong><strong>
</strong></strong>
<ol>
	<li><strong>995 Million People Can't be Wrong.</strong> We've never seen these type of numbers. Ever. In any medium. People routinely talk about 1 billion people having watched the Super Bowl or the Academy Awards on television. The largest television audience ever generated was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/tv-column/post/super-bowl-xlvi-no-tv-ratings-record/2012/02/06/gIQAVAD6tQ_blog.html">111 million people</a>. The passive Facebook audience, those that log on but don't post content, is 135 million. Bear in mind that this audience has been created on a platform that is only 8 years old. Analysts, pundits and financial wonks will tell you that "the user growth is slowing" and that FB has "hit a lull". If the audience growth stopped cold tomorrow, FB would still have the largest engaged reach of any medium ever created. By far. And the value of this audience, given its size and demographics, will continue to go up, as the challenge of aggregating large audiences gets harder and harder in a fragmented media world.</li>
	<li><strong>It's About the Product.</strong> Mark Zuckerberg innately understands that the key to building a great company is to focus myopically on building insanely great products. FB has been designed with a focus on the user experience. Facebook turned down General Motor's request for unique ad units that would take over the FB home page. As a result they lost a $10 million customer right before their IPO. This is a focus on product and user experience. Yes, conspiracy theorists also suggest that Facebook is taking your personal data and will be doing all sorts of evil things with it. You are in far more danger of your local dry cleaner or neighborhood restaurant misusing your credit card data than you are of Facebook misusing your personal data.</li>
	<li><strong>Social &amp; Mobile.</strong> Many analysts have pointed out that Mobile represents an enormous threat to Facebook's future, as more and more people access the web from smartphones and other mobile devices. Ok. Hang on a minute here. What exactly are people accessing via mobile devices?  Oh, their Facebook networks heh? Look we are now officially in the Mobile web era. Technology has always been purchased for specific applications and uses, however. People are and will continue to use Mobile devices to access their social graphs and as they do so Facebook's traffic and revenues will grow as a result.</li>
	<li><strong>Brand Marketing Matters.</strong> The "B" word, branding, has taken it on the chin in the first two waves of the Internet. Infomercials that drive direct marketing response have reigned supreme and Google's ingenious, automated AdSense platform has dominated the landscape. But there is a massive amount of advertising and marketing that has been left on the sidelines when it comes to digital advertising. The demand for brand advertising has kept television, some print magazines and outdoor relatively healthy the last decade. Facebook is the first online platform that holds the potential to truly serve the needs of both the brand marketer and the direct marketer at scale. Facebook is hard at work demonstrating the value for passive ads on the site based on demographics. Once this takes off, every ad agency in the world can finally dive in the pool and make money creating and buying online advertising. This will create a world of hurt for television, but that's for another post.</li>
	<li><strong>Facebook as a Platform.</strong> In the mid-90's it appeared that the Web Browser could replace Windows as the dominant platform in computing. Microsoft's rapid reaction to Netscape put a hitch in that plan however. Microsoft reacted so aggressively because they knew whoever controlled the platform ultimately controlled the entire ecosystem. Today social networks have become platforms. Social networks sit at the center of gravity of the computing experience. They are the application that is always on, regardless of the device or platform and as such systems are and will be built to optimize the social experience online. Facebook has the potential to become the dominant platform and a strong and vibrant Facebook economy is emerging.</li>
</ol>
No stock price predictions here. Simply my take on the value of Facebook as a brand and platform. And yes, I'm going long on Facebook.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[My economics professor would be so proud. I was listening after all. Scarcity does drive all markets. Even if the digital revolution we are living through sometimes makes us feel like ubiquity does. The Internet has proven to be an enormously disruptive force for many industries, uniquely so for media, commoditizing and displacing newspapers, magazines, books, music and more to come. Many media companies with print businesses, have focused on live events as safe havens, hoping against hope that digital technology wouldn't or couldn't disrupt exhibitions, conferences and events. Many of these same companies held their breath when virtual events and "hybrid-events"; virtual extensions from live events, were launched, again hoping that this wasn't the beginning of the long and painful slide they had seen with their print businesses. The reality is however digital media is proving to be a natural ally of live media. Frankly the synergy between digital media and live media is what we had dreamed digital and print would be…but never was. In a digitally-centric world, bringing high-demographic people together in one place at one time around common interests is the ultimate scarcity. In this regard, digital media is actually accentuating the value of live media. Even if exhibition, conference and event producers haven't yet caught up to this fact.

Just because digital is turning out to be friend not foe for live media at this stage, does not mean that exhibition companies don't face challenges however. They do. The current <a href="http://www.ceir.org/">Center for Exhibition Industry Research Index</a> forecasts increases in exhibition and attendance over the next several years but for the most part the numbers are still below historic highs. At the same time, <a href="http://www.outsellinc.com/">Outsell Inc</a> research shows that marketers have started to expand their event spending, increasing the percentage they spend on their own corporate events as opposed to traditional exhibitions and conferences. And while not directly competitive, the rapid rise of digital marketing options competes for attention and for overall marketing budget with exhibitions.

On Thursday September 13th I'll be leading a panel at the Center for Exhibition Industry Research: <a href="http://www.ceir.org/predict/" target="_blank">CEIR Predict Conference</a> in New York City, where we will be addressing these and other issues facing the exhibition industry. The conference is based on the annual CEIR Index that forecasts attendance and revenue for business-to-business exhibitions in 14 major industry categories. The CEIR Index has become a major resource for exhibition operators as well as investors and industry analysts. My panelists, Joe Loggia: CEO of <a href="http://www.advanstar.com/" target="_blank">Advanstar</a> and Sandra Toms Lepedis: VP/GM of <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/events/index.htm" target="_blank">RSA</a> and I will be focusing on the IT, Communications and Consumer Goods and Retail sectors. These sectors are leading indicators for the exhibition industry certainly but they also serve as beacons for the overall economy; given that business technology purchasing and consumer confidence are two of the major predictors of economic growth and well being.

We will be focussing our discussion around four main themes:
<ol>
	<li>The outlook for overall exhibitions and events</li>
	<li>The outlook for events in the IT, Communications and Consumer sectors</li>
	<li>The impact of marketers spending more on their own corporate events</li>
	<li>The impact of digital marketing on exhibitions</li>
</ol>
So what does this have to do with scarcity? Everything. As someone who has run some of the largest exhibitions and conferences in B2B Media , I can tell you that we as an industry have done very little to illuminate the unique value that exhibition's and events have today. You think Steve Jobs introduced every significant new product he ever launched at an event because he liked trade shows? High-quality business events serve as strategic marketing platforms; attracting buyers, sellers, the worldwide press and the entire industry ecosystem in one place and one time, creating an event-driven marketing opportunity that can be sustained and refreshed thematically via digital media. Take a lap around the web and check out how much business content comes from major events today. Keynotes at industry exhibitions are regularly streamed, posted and passed around via Twitter and other social networks. Video from conferences like TED serve as tutorials and guides. Companies and entire industry sectors organize product launch dates, company meetings and related events around major industry events to increase impact and efficiency. And the fragmented media world the web has created makes live events even more valuable.

My beef with my own industry however is I think we still position exhibitions and events based on square footage…not on value. We need to understand how to present the narrative of the value of live media in a digitally-centric world. We need to help marketers understand the strategic marketing platform that exhibitions represent, as opposed to being just a line item in an annual marketing budget. We need to present our events for what they are, the ultimate scarcity. If you'll be attending CEIR Predict please drop by and say hello. If not I'll post the presentation we will use to pace our discussion here. As always, feel free to add your comments to this post and let me know your thoughts.

				<![CDATA[Last May, after 6 great years at UBM – and a decade helping legacy media businesses adapt to a new reality defined by the Internet – I decided to <a href="http://www.uphoffonmedia.com/2012/05/19/whats-next/">step back</a>.  I wanted to really explore the trends that continue to reshape media, marketing and technology before deciding what to do next. Over the past months I’ve talked to dozens of great companies and individuals, learned a great deal and had a great time.

Today I'm thrilled to <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/businesscom-media-inc-appoints-tony-uphoff-as-chief-executive-officer-186942451.html" target="_blank">announce</a> that I've joined <a href="http://business.com/">Business.com</a> as CEO. I couldn't be more excited to join the new leadership team at Business.com and the family of <a href="http://www.jmi.com/">JMI Equity</a> companies. So why Business.com?

JMI Equity acquired Business.com in order to create the leading online source for business product and services purchasing. They’ve attracted a world-class team and established a new headquarters for the company in Carlsbad, California, a fast growing tech center in north county San Diego. Business.com is a brand, company and team of people that is uniquely positioned to serve buyers looking for products and services and marketers looking to reach, engage and sell to them.

In the next few months we will be rolling out a new site, new features and other plans for growing Business.com. I'm excited to be a part of the team and look forward to sharing more about our plans and what I learn along the way.]]>		</content:encoded>

				<![CDATA[When I joined <a href="http://business.com" target="_blank">Business.com</a> last month I mentioned we would have some news coming soon. Well, soon is today and I'm excited to <a href="http://www.business.com/blog/the-new-business-com/" target="_blank">announce</a> we're officially launching the new Business.com -- including a new site, new company identity, new features and an expanded product line. For my Media, Marketing and Tech geek pals I wanted to share a few thoughts on the changes in the media business that fueled my interest in joining the team and that helped drive our thinking around the new Business.com.

I believe there have been two foundational "From-To" shifts in the media business.
<ol>
	<li>Audiences have shifted from interest to intention. People can now discover and engage with information that maps to their specific needs and signal their intentions based on their digital body language-whether their intention is the acquisition of more knowledge, social engagement or the actual purchase of products and services.</li>
	<li>Marketers have made a corresponding "From-To" shift, from targeting based on demographics to targeting based on intention.</li>
</ol>
These shifts are ushering in a new era of Intention-Based Media that will have a profound impact on the way buyers discover, learn about, compare and buy products and services and how they engage with and buy from marketers. These trends are also creating a significant market transition in business media -- one that will ultimately make the shift from print-to digital look mild by comparison.

The new Business.com reflects the research and analysis we've done to better understand what buyers want today as they look to discover, learn about, compare and buy business products online. We believe that our new design and approach is a strong example of Intention-Based Media and a significant step towards how business media will operate in the future.

Our new site is only one step however. We are already hard at work on  v 2.0-which will include further refinements to our platform, an expansion of our suite of performance marketing products, heightened levels of contextual content integration and functionality as well as social and mobile enhancements. Our intention is to have Business.com serve as a platform that buyer, marketer and industry application developer, can each harness to run and grow their businesses.

These are extraordinary times in media, marketing and technology and certainly extraordinary times for us at <a href="http://business.com/">Business.com</a>. I look forward to continuing to share our journey and to getting your feedback. We're also hiring! Business.com is actively recruiting for sales executives, performance marketing specialists, developers and many other roles, so take a look at our About Us or Careers page for more details.]]>		</content:encoded>

				What Do Spinal Tap, Selling in a Digital World &amp; Marketing Complexity Have in Common? 		</title>

				<![CDATA[They have more in common than you might imagine.

In addition to being <a href="http://business.com" target="_blank">Business.com</a>’s CEO, I’ve been writing about sales, marketing and management for our audience. Lately I’ve covered the challenges of selling in a digital world, the era of marketing complexity, and the veracity of digital media numbers. I’ve also had the chance to quote my favorite fictional heavy metal guitarist, Nigel Tufnel. Turn it up to 11 indeed.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sales</strong>. The value proposition for sales in business-to-business used to be simple; if you had industry and product expertise you were of tremendous value to customers. But buyers today can access more information on your company, product or service by tapping the wisdom of their social/business networks and reviewing your website, than anyone in your sales organization can provide. The balance of power between buyer and seller has shifted, creating the need for sales organizations to rethink how they add value and engage customers. I outline the challenge of selling in a digital world and prescribe 5 tips for improving your sales efforts in the post: <a href="http://www.business.com/b2bmarketing/increasingly-saying-sales-problem-5-tips-selling-digital-world/" target="_blank">Are you Increasingly Saying “We Have a Sales Problem”? 5 Tips for Selling in the Digital World.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Marketing</strong>. It’s not clear yet whether this is a golden age for marketers or a nightmare. Marketers today have access to a dizzying array of new technologies, platforms, systems and networks, with a new one launching every week. At first blush, it would appear that these technologies are ushering in a new era of efficiency and return on investment. Upon further examination, however, they are also ushering in a level of complexity that is distracting, confusing and frustrating for many marketers. An old adage a professor of mine used to quote comes to mind; “Complexity in business equals cost. If you’re not the one selling the complexity, you’re the one paying for it”. I offer some solutions for marketers in the post: <a href="http://www.business.com/blog/top-4-tips-for-dealing-with-marketing-complexity/" target="_blank">The Top 4 Tips for Dealing with Marketing Complexity</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Media</strong>. Back in the mid-90’s I was part of a team that revolutionized Business-to-Business publishing. We did it by changing the editorial formula for the magazine InformationWeek and then more than doubling the circulation to over 400,000. This was back when a large circulation for a controlled circulation magazine was 200,000. InformationWeek Magazine went on to become the largest B2B magazine in the world in terms of ad pages and revenue and one of the largest B2B brands in history. I mention this to give some perspective to the issue of audience numbers in B2B digital media today. Like my favorite fictional heavy metal guitarist Nigel Tufnel, who’s amps famously went to 11, the numbers simply don’t make sense anymore. When the quoted reach and engagement numbers exceed the number of US businesses in existence, it’s time for a dose of reality. I call my own industry into the town square for some tough love in the post: <a href="http://www.business.com/b2bmarketing/turn-11-b2b-digital-media-spinal-tap-moment/" target="_blank">Turn it Up to 11: B2B Media is Having it’s Spinal Tap Moment.</a></li>
</ul>
It’s been a blast to interact with the Business.com audience via these posts. For my friends, colleagues and fellow media and marketing geeks who read Uphoff On Media, I wanted to do a brief roundup of these posts for your enjoyment. As always, your thoughts, comments and sharing are greatly appreciated!]]>		</content:encoded>
